97. ‘‘Tīhi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgato rañño bhadro [bhaddo (ka.)] assājānīyo rājāraho hoti rājabhoggo, rañño aṅganteva saṅkhyaṃ [saṅkhaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] gacchati. Katamehi tīhi? Idha, bhikkhave, rañño bhadro assājānīyo vaṇṇasampanno ca hoti balasampanno ca javasampanno ca. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, tīhi aṅgehi samannāgato rañño bhadro assājānīyo rājāraho hoti rājabhoggo, rañño aṅganteva saṅkhyaṃ gacchati. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, tīhi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu āhuneyyo hoti pāhuneyyo dakkhiṇeyyo añjalikaraṇīyo anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassa. Katamehi tīhi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vaṇṇasampanno ca hoti balasampanno ca javasampanno ca.

97."Monks, endowed with three qualities, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is fit for a king, a king's asset, and reckoned as a limb of the king. What are the three? Here, monks, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is accomplished in appearance, accomplished in strength, and accomplished in speed. Endowed with these three qualities, monks, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is fit for a king, a king's asset, and reckoned as a limb of the king. In the same way, monks, a monk endowed with three qualities is worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of gifts, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What are the three? Here, monks, a monk is accomplished in appearance, accomplished in strength, and accomplished in speed.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vaṇṇasampanno hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sīlavā hoti, pātimokkhasaṃvarasaṃvuto viharati ācāragocarasampanno aṇumattesu vajjesu bhayadassāvī, samādāya sikkhati sikkhāpadesu. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vaṇṇasampanno hoti.

"And how, monks, is a monk accomplished in appearance? Here, monks, a monk is virtuous, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the Pātimokkha, perfected in conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults, he trains himself by undertaking the training rules. It is in this way, monks, that a monk is accomplished in appearance."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu balasampanno hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu āraddhavīriyo viharati akusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ pahānāya kusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ upasampadāya thāmavā daḷhaparakkamo anikkhittadhuro kusalesu dhammesu. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu balasampanno hoti.

"And how, monks, is a monk accomplished in strength? Here, monks, a monk dwells with energy aroused for abandoning unwholesome qualities and attaining wholesome qualities; firm in strength, with steadfast exertion, not neglecting the duty in regard to wholesome qualities. It is in this way, monks, that a monk is accomplished in strength."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu javasampanno hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti; ‘ayaṃ dukkhasamudayo’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti; ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodho’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti; ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu javasampanno hoti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, tīhi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu āhuneyyo hoti pāhuneyyo dakkhiṇeyyo añjalikaraṇīyo anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassā’’ti. Pañcamaṃ.

"And how, monks, is a monk accomplished in speed? Here, monks, a monk understands as it really is: ‘This is suffering’; he understands as it really is: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; he understands as it really is: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; he understands as it really is: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’ It is in this way, monks, that a monk is accomplished in speed. Monks, a monk endowed with these three qualities is worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of gifts, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world." The fifth.
