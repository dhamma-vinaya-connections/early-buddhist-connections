# AN 3.29 Andhasuttaṃ

## AN 3.29 The Blind Sutta

29. ‘‘Tayome, bhikkhave, puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ. Katame tayo? Andho, ekacakkhu, dvicakkhu. Katamo ca, bhikkhave, puggalo andho? Idha, bhikkhave, ekaccassa puggalassa tathārūpaṃ cakkhu na hoti yathārūpena cakkhunā anadhigataṃ vā bhogaṃ adhigaccheyya adhigataṃ vā bhogaṃ phātiṃ kareyya [phātikareyya (sī.)]; tathārūpampissa cakkhu na hoti yathārūpena cakkhunā kusalākusale dhamme jāneyya, sāvajjānavajje dhamme jāneyya, hīnappaṇīte dhamme jāneyya, kaṇhasukkasappaṭibhāge dhamme jāneyya. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, puggalo andho.

29.Bhikkhus, these three types of persons are found existing in the world. What three? The blind, the one-eyed, and the two-eyed. And what, bhikkhus, is the blind person? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person does not have the kind of eye by which he might gain wealth not yet gained or increase wealth already gained; nor does he have the kind of eye by which he might know wholesome and unwholesome qualities, blameworthy and blameless qualities, inferior and superior qualities, dark and bright qualities with their counterparts. This, bhikkhus, is called the blind person.

‘‘Katamo ca, bhikkhave, puggalo ekacakkhu? Idha, bhikkhave, ekaccassa puggalassa tathārūpaṃ cakkhu hoti yathārūpena cakkhunā anadhigataṃ vā bhogaṃ adhigaccheyya adhigataṃ vā bhogaṃ phātiṃ kareyya; tathārūpaṃ panassa [tathārūpampissa (syā. kaṃ. pī. ka.)] cakkhu na hoti yathārūpena cakkhunā kusalākusale dhamme jāneyya, sāvajjānavajje dhamme jāneyya, hīnappaṇīte dhamme jāneyya, kaṇhasukkasappaṭibhāge dhamme jāneyya. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, puggalo ekacakkhu.

And what, bhikkhus, is the one-eyed person? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person has the kind of eye by which he might gain wealth not yet gained or increase wealth already gained; but he does not have the kind of eye by which he might know wholesome and unwholesome qualities, blameworthy and blameless qualities, inferior and superior qualities, dark and bright qualities with their counterparts. This, bhikkhus, is called the one-eyed person.

‘‘Katamo ca, bhikkhave, puggalo dvicakkhu? Idha, bhikkhave, ekaccassa puggalassa tathārūpaṃ cakkhu hoti yathārūpena cakkhunā anadhigataṃ vā bhogaṃ adhigaccheyya, adhigataṃ vā bhogaṃ phātiṃ kareyya; tathārūpampissa cakkhu hoti yathārūpena cakkhunā kusalākusale dhamme jāneyya; sāvajjānavajje dhamme jāneyya, hīnappaṇīte dhamme jāneyya, kaṇhasukkasappaṭibhāge dhamme jāneyya. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, puggalo dvicakkhu. ‘Ime kho, bhikkhave, tayo puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmi’’’nti.

And what, bhikkhus, is the two-eyed person? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person has the kind of eye by which he might gain wealth not yet gained or increase wealth already gained; and he also has the kind of eye by which he might know wholesome and unwholesome qualities, blameworthy and blameless qualities, inferior and superior qualities, dark and bright qualities with their counterparts. This, bhikkhus, is called the two-eyed person. These, bhikkhus, are the three types of persons found existing in the world.

‘‘Na ceva bhogā tathārūpā, na ca puññāni kubbati;Ubhayattha kaliggāho, andhassa hatacakkhuno.

Wealth of that kind does not exist for him, nor does he perform meritorious deeds; he is defeated on both counts, the blind man whose eye is lost.

‘‘Athāparāyaṃ akkhāto, ekacakkhu ca puggalo;Dhammādhammena saṭhoso [saṃsaṭṭho (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.), saṭhoti (ka.)], bhogāni pariyesati.

Then another person is described, the one-eyed one; deceitful and cunning, he seeks wealth by fair and foul means.

‘‘Theyyena kūṭakammena, musāvādena cūbhayaṃ;Kusalo hoti saṅghātuṃ [saṃhātuṃ (syā.)], kāmabhogī ca mānavo;Ito so nirayaṃ gantvā, ekacakkhu vihaññati.

By theft, fraud, and false speech, a man is skilled at accumulating wealth and indulges in sensual pleasures; from here he goes to hell, where the one-eyed being is afflicted.

‘‘Dvicakkhu pana akkhāto, seṭṭho purisapuggalo;Dhammaladdhehi bhogehi, uṭṭhānādhigataṃ dhanaṃ.

The two-eyed one is spoken of as the foremost of persons; with wealth obtained through the Dhamma, riches acquired by effort.

‘‘Dadāti seṭṭhasaṅkappo, abyaggamānaso naro;Upeti bhaddakaṃ ṭhānaṃ, yattha gantvā na socati.

He gives with the highest resolve, a man with an unshaken mind; he attains an auspicious state, where, having gone, he does not grieve.

‘‘Andhañca ekacakkhuñca, ārakā parivajjaye;Dvicakkhuṃ pana sevetha, seṭṭhaṃ purisapuggala’’nti. navamaṃ;

The blind and the one-eyed, one should avoid from afar; but associate with the two-eyed, the foremost of persons.
