# AN 3.90 Dutiyasikkhattayasuttaṃ

## AN 3.90 The Second Discourse on the Three Trainings

91. ‘‘Tisso imā, bhikkhave, sikkhā. Katamā tisso? Adhisīlasikkhā, adhicittasikkhā, adhipaññāsikkhā.

91."Bhikkhus, there are these three trainings. Which three? The higher training in virtue, the higher training in mind, and the higher training in wisdom."

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, adhisīlasikkhā? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sīlavā hoti…pe… samādāya sikkhati sikkhāpadesu. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, adhisīlasikkhā.

"And what, bhikkhus, is the higher training in virtue? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is virtuous…he trains himself by undertaking the training rules. This, bhikkhus, is called the higher training in virtue."

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, adhicittasikkhā? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vivicceva kāmehi…pe… catutthaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, adhicittasikkhā.

"And what, bhikkhus, is the higher training in mind? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, quite secluded from sensual pleasures…enters and dwells in the fourth jhana. This, bhikkhus, is called the higher training in mind."

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, adhipaññāsikkhā? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu āsavānaṃ khayā anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharati. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, adhipaññā sikkhā. Imā kho, bhikkhave, tisso sikkhā’’ti.

"And what, bhikkhus, is the higher training in wisdom? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, through the destruction of the taints, having directly known by himself with direct knowledge, realizes and dwells in the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, in this very life. This, bhikkhus, is called the higher training in wisdom. These, bhikkhus, are the three trainings."

‘‘Adhisīlaṃ adhicittaṃ, adhipaññañca vīriyavā;Thāmavā dhitimā jhāyī, sato guttindriyo [uppattindriyo (ka.)] care.

"Energetic in higher virtue, higher mind, and higher wisdom; strong, resolute, meditative, mindful, with guarded faculties, let him fare."

‘‘Yathā pure tathā pacchā, yathā pacchā tathā pure;Yathā adho tathā uddhaṃ, yathā uddhaṃ tathā adho.

"As before, so after; as after, so before; As below, so above; as above, so below."

‘‘Yathā divā tathā rattiṃ, yathā rattiṃ tathā divā;Abhibhuyya disā sabbā, appamāṇasamādhinā.

"As by day, so by night; as by night, so by day, having mastered all quarters, with boundless concentration."

‘‘Tamāhu sekhaṃ paṭipadaṃ [pāṭipadaṃ (?) ma. ni. 2.27 passitabbaṃ], atho saṃsuddhacāriyaṃ [saṃsuddhacāraṇaṃ (sī. pī.), saṃsuddhacārinaṃ (syā. kaṃ.)];Tamāhu loke sambuddhaṃ, dhīraṃ paṭipadantaguṃ.

"They call him a learner, one on the path, and also one of pure conduct; They call him the Fully Awakened One in the world, the steadfast one who has reached the end of the practice."

‘‘Viññāṇassa nirodhena, taṇhākkhayavimuttino;Pajjotasseva nibbānaṃ, vimokkho hoti cetaso’’ti. dasamaṃ;

"Through the cessation of consciousness, for one liberated by the destruction of craving, like the extinguishing of a lamp, there is liberation of mind." Tenth.
