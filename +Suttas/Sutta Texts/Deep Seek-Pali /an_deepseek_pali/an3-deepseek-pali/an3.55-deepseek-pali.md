## AN 3.55 The Discourse on a Wanderer

55. Atha kho aññataro brāhmaṇaparibbājako yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā…pe… ekamantaṃ nisinno kho so brāhmaṇaparibbājako bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘‘sandiṭṭhiko dhammo sandiṭṭhiko dhammo’ti, bho gotama, vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho, bho gotama, sandiṭṭhiko dhammo hoti akāliko ehipassiko opaneyyiko paccattaṃ veditabbo viññūhī’’ti?

55.Then a certain brahmin wanderer approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One and, when they had concluded their exchange of greetings, he sat down to one side. Seated to one side, that brahmin wanderer said to the Blessed One: “‘The Dhamma is visible here and now, the Dhamma is visible here and now,’ it is said, Master Gotama. To what extent, Master Gotama, is the Dhamma visible here and now, immediate, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be personally experienced by the wise?”

‘‘Ratto kho, brāhmaṇa, rāgena abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto attabyābādhāyapi ceteti, parabyābādhāyapi ceteti, ubhayabyābādhāyapi ceteti, cetasikampi dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti. Rāge pahīne nevattabyābādhāyapi ceteti, na parabyābādhāyapi ceteti, na ubhayabyābādhāyapi ceteti, na cetasikampi dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti.

“Brahmin, one who is lustful, overcome by lust, with a mind obsessed by it, intends harm to himself, intends harm to others, intends harm to both, and experiences mental suffering and displeasure. When lust is abandoned, one does not intend harm to himself, intend harm to others, or intend harm to both, and does not experience mental suffering and displeasure.

‘‘Ratto kho, brāhmaṇa, rāgena abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto kāyena duccaritaṃ carati, vācāya duccaritaṃ carati, manasā duccaritaṃ carati. Rāge pahīne neva kāyena duccaritaṃ carati, na vācāya duccaritaṃ carati, na manasā duccaritaṃ carati.

“Brahmin, one who is lustful, overcome by lust, with a mind obsessed by it, engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. When lust is abandoned, one does not engage in misconduct by body, speech, or mind.

‘‘Ratto kho, brāhmaṇa, rāgena abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto attatthampi yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti, paratthampi yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti, ubhayatthampi yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Rāge pahīne attatthampi yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, paratthampi yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, ubhayatthampi yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Evampi kho, brāhmaṇa, sandiṭṭhiko dhammo hoti…pe….

“Brahmin, one who is lustful, overcome by lust, with a mind obsessed by it, does not understand as it really is what is for one’s own benefit, nor what is for the benefit of others, nor what is for the benefit of both. When lust is abandoned, one understands as it really is what is for one’s own benefit, what is for the benefit of others, and what is for the benefit of both. In this way, brahmin, the Dhamma is visible here and now...

‘‘Duṭṭho kho, brāhmaṇa, dosena…pe… mūḷho kho, brāhmaṇa, mohena abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto attabyābādhāyapi ceteti, parabyābādhāyapi ceteti, ubhayabyābādhāyapi ceteti, cetasikampi dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti. Mohe pahīne nevattabyābādhāyapi ceteti, na parabyābādhāyapi ceteti, na ubhayabyābādhāyapi ceteti, na cetasikaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti.

“Brahmin, one who is hateful, overcome by hatred, with a mind obsessed by it, intends harm to himself, intends harm to others, intends harm to both, and experiences mental suffering and displeasure. When hatred is abandoned, one does not intend harm to himself, intend harm to others, or intend harm to both, and does not experience mental suffering and displeasure. Brahmin, one who is deluded, overcome by delusion, with a mind obsessed by it, intends harm to himself, intends harm to others, intends harm to both, and experiences mental suffering and displeasure. When delusion is abandoned, one does not intend harm to himself, intend harm to others, or intend harm to both, and does not experience mental suffering and displeasure.

‘‘Mūḷho kho, brāhmaṇa, mohena abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto, kāyena duccaritaṃ carati, vācāya duccaritaṃ carati, manasā duccaritaṃ carati. Mohe pahīne neva kāyena duccaritaṃ carati, na vācāya duccaritaṃ carati, na manasā duccaritaṃ carati.

“Brahmin, one who is deluded, overcome by delusion, with a mind obsessed by it, engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. When delusion is abandoned, one does not engage in misconduct by body, speech, or mind.

‘‘Mūḷho kho, brāhmaṇa, mohena abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto attatthampi yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti, paratthampi yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti, ubhayatthampi yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Mohe pahīne attatthampi yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, paratthampi yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, ubhayatthampi yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Evaṃ kho, brāhmaṇa, sandiṭṭhiko dhammo hoti akāliko ehipassiko opaneyyiko paccattaṃ veditabbo viññūhī’’ti.

“Brahmin, one who is deluded, overcome by delusion, with a mind obsessed by it, does not understand as it really is what is for one’s own benefit, nor what is for the benefit of others, nor what is for the benefit of both. When delusion is abandoned, one understands as it really is what is for one’s own benefit, what is for the benefit of others, and what is for the benefit of both. In this way, brahmin, the Dhamma is visible here and now, immediate, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be personally experienced by the wise.”

‘‘Abhikkantaṃ, bho gotama…pe… upāsakaṃ maṃ bhavaṃ gotamo dhāretu ajjatagge pāṇupetaṃ saraṇaṃ gata’’nti. Catutthaṃ.

“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Just as if someone were to set upright what was overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or point out the way to one who is lost, or hold up a lamp in the darkness, thinking, ‘Those with eyes will see forms,’ just so has the Dhamma been made clear by Master Gotama in many ways. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for as long as life lasts.”
