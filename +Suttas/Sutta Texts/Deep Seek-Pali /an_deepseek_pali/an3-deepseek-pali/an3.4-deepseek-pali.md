# AN 3.4 Accayasuttaṃ

## AN 3.4 The Fault Discourse

4. ‘‘Tīhi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bālo veditabbo. Katamehi tīhi? Accayaṃ accayato na passati, accayaṃ accayato disvā yathādhammaṃ nappaṭikaroti, parassa kho pana accayaṃ desentassa yathādhammaṃ nappaṭiggaṇhāti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, tīhi dhammehi samannāgato bālo veditabbo.

4. "Monks, a fool is known by three qualities. Which three? He does not see an offense as an offense; having seen an offense as an offense, he does not atone for it according to the Dhamma; and when another confesses an offense, he does not accept it according to the Dhamma. Monks, a fool is known by these three qualities."

‘‘Tīhi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato paṇḍito veditabbo. Katamehi tīhi? Accayaṃ accayato passati, accayaṃ accayato disvā yathādhammaṃ paṭikaroti, parassa kho pana accayaṃ desentassa yathādhammaṃ paṭiggaṇhāti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, tīhi dhammehi samannāgato paṇḍito veditabbo. Tasmātiha…. Catutthaṃ.

"Monks, one endowed with three qualities is to be known as wise. What three? He sees an offense as an offense; having seen an offense as an offense, he makes amends according to the Dhamma; and when another confesses an offense, he accepts it according to the Dhamma. Monks, one endowed with these three qualities is to be known as wise. Therefore... Fourth."
