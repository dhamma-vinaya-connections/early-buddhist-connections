## AN 3.10 The Stain Discourse

10. ‘‘Tīhi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato tayo male appahāya yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ niraye. Katamehi tīhi? Dussīlo ca hoti, dussīlyamalañcassa appahīnaṃ hoti; issukī ca hoti, issāmalañcassa appahīnaṃ hoti; maccharī ca hoti, maccheramalañcassa appahīnaṃ hoti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, tīhi dhammehi samannāgato ime tayo male appahāya yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ niraye.

10. "Monks, one endowed with three qualities, not having abandoned three taints, is deposited in hell just as he is. What three? One is immoral, and the taint of immorality is not abandoned; one is jealous, and the taint of jealousy is not abandoned; one is miserly, and the taint of miserliness is not abandoned. Monks, one endowed with these three qualities, not having abandoned these three taints, is deposited in hell just as he is."

‘‘Tīhi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato tayo male pahāya yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ sagge. Katamehi tīhi? Sīlavā ca hoti, dussīlyamalañcassa pahīnaṃ hoti; anissukī ca hoti, issāmalañcassa pahīnaṃ hoti; amaccharī ca hoti, maccheramalañcassa pahīnaṃ hoti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, tīhi dhammehi samannāgato ime tayo male pahāya yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ sagge’’ti. Dasamaṃ.

"Monks, one endowed with three qualities, having abandoned three taints, is deposited in heaven just as he is. What three? One is virtuous, and the taint of immorality is abandoned; one is not jealous, and the taint of jealousy is abandoned; one is not miserly, and the taint of miserliness is abandoned. Monks, one endowed with these three qualities, having abandoned these three taints, is deposited in heaven just as he is." The tenth.
