## AN 3.117 The Discourse on Corruptions and Accomplishments

118. ‘‘Tisso imā, bhikkhave, vipattiyo. Katamā tisso? Sīlavipatti, cittavipatti, diṭṭhivipatti. Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sīlavipatti? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco pāṇātipātī hoti, adinnādāyī hoti, kāmesumicchācārī hoti, musāvādī hoti, pisuṇavāco hoti, pharusavāco hoti, samphappalāpī hoti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, sīlavipatti.

118.“Bhikkhus, there are these three corruptions. What three? The corruption of virtue, the corruption of mind, and the corruption of view. And what, bhikkhus, is the corruption of virtue? Here, bhikkhus, some person is a killer of living beings, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsely, speaks divisively, speaks harshly, and indulges in idle chatter. This, bhikkhus, is called the corruption of virtue.

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, cittavipatti? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco abhijjhālu hoti byāpannacitto. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, cittavipatti.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the corruption of mind? Here, bhikkhus, some person is covetous and has a mind of ill will. This, bhikkhus, is called the corruption of mind.”

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, diṭṭhivipatti? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco micchādiṭṭhiko hoti viparītadassano – ‘natthi dinnaṃ, natthi yiṭṭhaṃ, natthi hutaṃ, natthi sukatadukkaṭānaṃ, kammānaṃ phalaṃ vipāko, natthi ayaṃ loko, natthi paro loko, natthi mātā, natthi pitā, natthi sattā opapātikā, natthi loke samaṇabrāhmaṇā sammaggatā sammāpaṭipannā ye imañca lokaṃ parañca lokaṃ sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedentī’ti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, diṭṭhivipatti. Sīlavipattihetu vā, bhikkhave, sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā apāyaṃ duggatiṃ vinipātaṃ nirayaṃ upapajjanti; cittavipattihetu vā, bhikkhave, sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā apāyaṃ duggatiṃ vinipātaṃ nirayaṃ upapajjanti; diṭṭhivipattihetu vā, bhikkhave, sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā apāyaṃ duggatiṃ vinipātaṃ nirayaṃ upapajjanti. Imā kho, bhikkhave, tisso vipattiyoti.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the corruption of view? Here, bhikkhus, some person holds a wrong view, has a distorted perspective, thinking: ‘There is no gift, no offering, no sacrifice; there is no fruit or result of wholesome and unwholesome actions; there is no this world, there is no other world; there is no mother, no father; there are no spontaneously arisen beings; there are no ascetics and brahmins in the world who have gone the right way and are practicing rightly, who, having themselves realized and directly known this world and the other world, declare it.’ This, bhikkhus, is called the corruption of view. Because of the corruption of virtue, bhikkhus, beings, on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in a state of deprivation, in a bad destination, in the lower realms, in hell. Because of the corruption of mind, bhikkhus, beings, on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in a state of deprivation, in a bad destination, in the lower realms, in hell. Because of the corruption of view, bhikkhus, beings, on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in a state of deprivation, in a bad destination, in the lower realms, in hell. These, bhikkhus, are the three corruptions.”

‘‘Tisso imā, bhikkhave, sampadā. Katamā tisso? Sīlasampadā, cittasampadā, diṭṭhisampadā. Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sīlasampadā? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco pāṇātipātā paṭivirato hoti, adinnādānā paṭivirato hoti, kāmesumicchācārā paṭivirato hoti, musāvādā paṭivirato hoti, pisuṇāya vācāya paṭivirato hoti, pharusāya vācāya paṭivirato hoti, samphappalāpā paṭivirato hoti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, sīlasampadā.

“Bhikkhus, there are these three accomplishments. What three? The accomplishment of virtue, the accomplishment of mind, and the accomplishment of view. And what, bhikkhus, is the accomplishment of virtue? Here, bhikkhus, some person abstains from killing living beings, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from divisive speech, abstains from harsh speech, and abstains from idle chatter. This, bhikkhus, is called the accomplishment of virtue.

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, cittasampadā? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco anabhijjhālu hoti abyāpannacitto. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, cittasampadā.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the accomplishment of mind? Here, bhikkhus, some person is not covetous and has a mind free of ill will. This, bhikkhus, is called the accomplishment of mind.”

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, diṭṭhisampadā? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco sammādiṭṭhiko hoti aviparītadassano – ‘atthi dinnaṃ, atthi yiṭṭhaṃ, atthi hutaṃ, atthi sukatadukkaṭānaṃ kammānaṃ phalaṃ vipāko, atthi ayaṃ loko, atthi paro loko, atthi mātā, atthi pitā, atthi sattā opapātikā, atthi loke samaṇabrāhmaṇā sammaggatā sammāpaṭipannā ye imañca lokaṃ parañca lokaṃ sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedentī’ti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, diṭṭhisampadā. Sīlasampadāhetu vā, bhikkhave, sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjanti; cittasampadāhetu vā, bhikkhave, sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjanti; diṭṭhisampadāhetu vā, bhikkhave, sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjanti. Imā kho, bhikkhave, tisso sampadā’’ti. Pañcamaṃ.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the accomplishment of view? Here, bhikkhus, some person holds a right view, has an undistorted perspective, thinking: ‘There is gift, there is offering, there is sacrifice; there is fruit and result of wholesome and unwholesome actions; there is this world, there is another world; there is mother, there is father; there are spontaneously arisen beings; there are ascetics and brahmins in the world who have gone the right way and are practicing rightly, who, having themselves realized and directly known this world and the other world, declare it.’ This, bhikkhus, is called the accomplishment of view. Because of the accomplishment of virtue, bhikkhus, beings, on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, in a heavenly world. Because of the accomplishment of mind, bhikkhus, beings, on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, in a heavenly world. Because of the accomplishment of view, bhikkhus, beings, on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, in a heavenly world. These, bhikkhus, are the three accomplishments.”
