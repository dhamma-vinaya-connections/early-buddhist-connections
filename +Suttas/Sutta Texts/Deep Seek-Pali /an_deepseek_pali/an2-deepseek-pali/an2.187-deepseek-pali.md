# AN 2.187

187."Monks, one endowed with two qualities is deposited in hell as if carried there. Which two? Anger and resentment... denigration and domineering... envy and stinginess... deceit and trickery... shamelessness and lack of moral dread. Endowed with these two qualities, monks, one is deposited in hell as if carried there."
