# AN 2.52

52.“Monks, there are these two kinds of assemblies. Which two? An assembly that speaks contrary to the Dhamma, and an assembly that speaks according to the Dhamma. And what, monks, is an assembly that speaks contrary to the Dhamma? Here, monks, in an assembly, monks take up a dispute, whether legitimate or illegitimate. Having taken up that dispute, they neither explain themselves to one another nor reach a settlement; they neither investigate nor come to a conclusion. Possessed of the strength of non-explanation and the strength of non-investigation, and with no intention of relinquishing, they cling to that very dispute, insisting with the strength of their view: ‘Only this is true; all else is worthless.’ This is called, monks, an assembly that speaks contrary to the Dhamma.”

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, dhammavādinī parisā? Idha, bhikkhave, yassaṃ parisāyaṃ bhikkhū adhikaraṇaṃ ādiyanti dhammikaṃ vā adhammikaṃ vā. Te taṃ adhikaraṇaṃ ādiyitvā aññamaññaṃ saññāpenti ceva saññattiñca upagacchanti, nijjhāpenti ceva nijjhattiñca upagacchanti. Te saññattibalā nijjhattibalā paṭinissaggamantino, na tameva adhikaraṇaṃ thāmasā parāmāsā abhinivissa voharanti – ‘idameva saccaṃ moghamañña’nti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, dhammavādinī parisā. Imā kho, bhikkhave, dve parisā. Etadaggaṃ, bhikkhave, imāsaṃ dvinnaṃ parisānaṃ yadidaṃ dhammavādinī parisā’’ti.

“And what, monks, is an assembly that speaks according to the Dhamma? Here, monks, in an assembly, monks take up a dispute, whether legitimate or illegitimate. Having taken up that dispute, they explain themselves to one another and reach an understanding; they investigate and reach a conclusion. Being strong in causing understanding and in reaching a conclusion, and being inclined to relinquish, they do not cling to that very dispute, insisting with the strength of their view: ‘Only this is true; all else is worthless.’ This is called, monks, an assembly that speaks according to the Dhamma. These, monks, are the two kinds of assemblies. Among these two assemblies, monks, the assembly that speaks according to the Dhamma is the foremost.”
