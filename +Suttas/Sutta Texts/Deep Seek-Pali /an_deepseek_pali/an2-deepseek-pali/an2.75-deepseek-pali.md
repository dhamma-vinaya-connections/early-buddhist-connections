# AN 2.75

75."Monks, there are these two kinds of happiness. What two? Happiness with an object of rapture and happiness with an object devoid of rapture. These, monks, are the two kinds of happiness. The foremost of these two kinds of happiness, monks, is happiness with an object devoid of rapture."
