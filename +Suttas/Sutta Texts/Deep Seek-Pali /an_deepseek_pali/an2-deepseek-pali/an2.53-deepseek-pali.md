# AN 2.53

53.“Monks, these two persons arise in the world for the welfare and happiness of many people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans. Which two? The Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, and a wheel-turning monarch. These two persons, monks, arise in the world for the welfare and happiness of many people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans.”
