# AN 2.185

185."Monks, these two qualities lead to the decline of a bhikkhu in training. Which two? Anger and resentment... denigration and domineering... envy and stinginess... deceit and trickery... shamelessness and lack of moral dread. These, monks, are the two qualities that lead to the decline of a bhikkhu in training."
