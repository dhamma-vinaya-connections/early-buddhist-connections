# AN 2.189

189."Monks, endowed with two qualities, some person here, upon the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, in hell. Which two? Anger and resentment... denigration and domineering... envy and stinginess... deceit and trickery... shamelessness and lack of moral dread. Endowed with these two qualities, some person here, upon the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, in hell."
