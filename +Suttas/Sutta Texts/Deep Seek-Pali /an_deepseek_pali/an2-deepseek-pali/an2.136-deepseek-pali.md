# AN 2.136

136."Monks, a foolish, unskilled, unrighteous person, endowed with two qualities, maintains a wounded and injured self, is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise, and generates much demerit. What are the two? Without investigating and thoroughly examining, they produce confidence in a place not worthy of confidence; without investigating and thoroughly examining, they produce lack of confidence in a place worthy of confidence. These, monks, are the two qualities."

‘‘Dvīhi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato paṇḍito viyatto sappuriso akkhataṃ anupahataṃ attānaṃ pariharati, anavajjo ca hoti ananuvajjo ca viññūnaṃ, bahuñca puññaṃ pasavati. Katamehi dvīhi? Anuvicca pariyogāhetvā appasādanīye ṭhāne appasādaṃ upadaṃseti, anuvicca pariyogāhetvā pasādanīye ṭhāne pasādaṃ upadaṃseti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, dvīhi dhammehi samannāgato paṇḍito viyatto sappuriso akkhataṃ anupahataṃ attānaṃ pariharati, anavajjo ca hoti ananuvajjo ca viññūnaṃ, bahuñca puññaṃ pasavatī’’ti.

"Monks, a wise, discerning, righteous person, endowed with two qualities, maintains an unwounded and uninjured self, is blameless and irreproachable by the wise, and generates much merit. What are the two? After investigating and thoroughly examining, they produce lack of confidence in a place not worthy of confidence; after investigating and thoroughly examining, they produce confidence in a place worthy of confidence. These, monks, are the two qualities."
