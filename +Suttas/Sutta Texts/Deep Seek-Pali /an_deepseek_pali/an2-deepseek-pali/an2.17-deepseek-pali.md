# AN 2.17

17. Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi approached the Blessed One; having approached, he exchanged polite greetings with the Blessed One. After an exchange of friendly, courteous talk, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the brahmin Jānussoṇi said to the Blessed One: "What now, Master Gotama, is the cause, what is the reason, why some beings here, on the dissolution of the body, after death, are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower realms, in hell?" "Because of deeds done and deeds not done, brahmin. Thus some beings here, on the dissolution of the body, after death, are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower realms, in hell." "But what now, Master Gotama, is the cause, what is the reason, why some beings here, on the dissolution of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in the heavenly world?" "Because of deeds done and deeds not done, brahmin. Thus some beings here, on the dissolution of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in the heavenly world." "I do not understand in detail the meaning of Master Gotama's brief statement, which has not been analyzed in detail. It would be good if Master Gotama would teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might understand in detail the meaning of Master Gotama's brief statement, which has not been analyzed in detail." "Then, brahmin, listen and attend carefully; I will speak." "Yes, sir," the brahmin Jānussoṇi replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:

‘‘Idha, brāhmaṇa, ekaccassa kāyaduccaritaṃ kataṃ hoti, akataṃ hoti kāyasucaritaṃ; vacīduccaritaṃ kataṃ hoti, akataṃ hoti vacīsucaritaṃ; manoduccaritaṃ kataṃ hoti, akataṃ hoti manosucaritaṃ. Evaṃ kho, brāhmaṇa, katattā ca akatattā ca evamidhekacce sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā apāyaṃ duggatiṃ vinipātaṃ nirayaṃ upapajjanti. Idha pana, brāhmaṇa, ekaccassa kāyasucaritaṃ kataṃ hoti, akataṃ hoti kāyaduccaritaṃ; vacīsucaritaṃ kataṃ hoti, akataṃ hoti vacīduccaritaṃ; manosucaritaṃ kataṃ hoti, akataṃ hoti manoduccaritaṃ. Evaṃ kho, brāhmaṇa, katattā ca akatattā ca evamidhekacce sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjantī’’ti.

"Here, brahmin, someone has done bodily misconduct and not done bodily good conduct; has done verbal misconduct and not done verbal good conduct; has done mental misconduct and not done mental good conduct. Thus, brahmin, because of deeds done and deeds not done, some beings here, on the dissolution of the body, after death, are reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower realms, in hell. But here, brahmin, someone has done bodily good conduct and not done bodily misconduct; has done verbal good conduct and not done verbal misconduct; has done mental good conduct and not done mental misconduct. Thus, brahmin, because of deeds done and deeds not done, some beings here, on the dissolution of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in the heavenly world."

‘‘Abhikkantaṃ, bho gotama…pe… upāsakaṃ maṃ bhavaṃ gotamo dhāretu ajjatagge pāṇupetaṃ saraṇaṃ gata’’nti.

"Excellent, Master Gotama... may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has taken refuge from this day forth, for as long as life lasts."
