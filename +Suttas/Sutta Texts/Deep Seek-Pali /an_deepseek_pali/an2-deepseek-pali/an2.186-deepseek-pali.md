# AN 2.186

186."Monks, these two qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu in training. Which two? Non-anger and non-resentment... non-denigration and non-domineering... non-envy and non-stinginess... non-deceit and non-trickery... shame and moral dread. These, monks, are the two qualities that lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu in training."
