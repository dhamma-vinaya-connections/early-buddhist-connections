# AN 2.13

13. "Monks, there are these two powers. What two? The power of reflection and the power of cultivation. And what, monks, is the power of reflection? Here, monks, someone reflects thus: ‘Bodily misconduct has a bad result in this very life and in the life to come; verbal misconduct has a bad result in this very life and in the life to come; mental misconduct has a bad result in this very life and in the life to come.’ Reflecting thus, one abandons bodily misconduct and develops bodily good conduct; one abandons verbal misconduct and develops verbal good conduct; one abandons mental misconduct and develops mental good conduct; one maintains oneself in purity. This, monks, is called the power of reflection.

Imāni kho, bhikkhave, dve balānī’’ti.

"And what, monks, is the power of cultivation? Here, monks, a monk, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion. With the subsiding of thought and examination, having inner assurance and unification of mind, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which is without thought and examination, and has rapture and happiness born of concentration. With the fading away of rapture, dwelling equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending, experiencing happiness with the body, he enters and dwells in the third jhāna, of which the noble ones declare: 'Equanimous and mindful, one who dwells happily.' With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is neither painful nor pleasant and the purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. This, monks, is called the power of cultivation. These, monks, are the two powers."
