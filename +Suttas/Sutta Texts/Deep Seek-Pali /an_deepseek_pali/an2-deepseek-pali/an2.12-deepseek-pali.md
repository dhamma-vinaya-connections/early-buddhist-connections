# AN 2.12

12. "Monks, there are these two powers. What two? The power of reflection and the power of cultivation. And what, monks, is the power of reflection? Here, monks, someone reflects thus: ‘Bodily misconduct has a bad result in this very life and in the life to come; verbal misconduct has a bad result in this very life and in the life to come; mental misconduct has a bad result in this very life and in the life to come.’ Reflecting thus, one abandons bodily misconduct and develops bodily good conduct; one abandons verbal misconduct and develops verbal good conduct; one abandons mental misconduct and develops mental good conduct; one maintains oneself in purity. This, monks, is called the power of reflection."

Idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, bhāvanābalaṃ. Imāni kho, bhikkhave, dve balānī’’ti.

"And what, monks, is the power of cultivation? Here, monks, a monk develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, which is based on seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, culminating in relinquishment. He develops the enlightenment factor of investigation of phenomena... the enlightenment factor of energy... the enlightenment factor of rapture... the enlightenment factor of tranquility... the enlightenment factor of concentration... the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based on seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, culminating in relinquishment. This, monks, is called the power of cultivation. These, monks, are the two powers."
