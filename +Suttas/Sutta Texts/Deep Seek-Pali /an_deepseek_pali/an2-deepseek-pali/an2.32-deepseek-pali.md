# AN 2.32

32. Monks, there are these two qualities that partake of knowledge. Which two? Tranquility and insight. Monks, what benefit accrues from cultivating tranquility? The mind is developed. What benefit accrues from developing the mind? Whatever passion there is, that is abandoned. Monks, what benefit accrues from cultivating insight? Wisdom is developed. What benefit accrues from developing wisdom? Whatever ignorance there is, that is abandoned. Monks, a mind contaminated by passion is not liberated, nor is wisdom developed when contaminated by ignorance. Thus, monks, from the fading away of passion, there is liberation of mind; from the fading away of ignorance, there is liberation by wisdom.
