# AN 2.16

16. Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One; having approached, he exchanged polite greetings with the Blessed One. Having exchanged amiable and memorable talk, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, that brahmin said to the Blessed One: "What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some beings here, after the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a state of misery, a bad destination, the lower world, even in hell?" "It is due to unrighteous conduct and uneven conduct, brahmin, that some beings here, after the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a state of misery, a bad destination, the lower world, even in hell."

‘‘Ko nu kho, bho gotama, hetu ko paccayo yena midhekacce sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjantī’’ti? ‘‘Dhammacariyāsamacariyāhetu kho, brāhmaṇa, evamidhekacce sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjantī’’ti.

"What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why some beings here, after the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world?"
"It is due to conduct in accordance with the Dhamma and even conduct, brahmin, that some beings here, after the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world."

‘‘Abhikkantaṃ, bho gotama! Abhikkantaṃ, bho gotama! Seyyathāpi, bho gotama, nikkujjitaṃ [nikujjitaṃ (ka.)] vā ukkujjeyya, paṭicchannaṃ vā vivareyya, mūḷhassa vā maggaṃ ācikkheyya, andhakāre vā telapajjotaṃ dhāreyya – ‘cakkhumanto rūpāni dakkhantī’ti, evamevaṃ bhotā gotamena anekapariyāyena dhammo pakāsito. Esāhaṃ bhavantaṃ gotamaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi dhammañca bhikkhusaṅghañca. Upāsakaṃ maṃ bhavaṃ gotamo dhāretu ajjatagge pāṇupetaṃ saraṇaṃ gata’’nti.

"Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Just as, Master Gotama, one might set upright what was overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or point out the path to one who was lost, or hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes might see forms, just so has the Dhamma been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has taken refuge from this day forth, for as long as life lasts."
