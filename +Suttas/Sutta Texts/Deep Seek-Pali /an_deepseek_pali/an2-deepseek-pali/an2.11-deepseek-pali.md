# AN 2.11

11. "Monks, there are these two powers. What two? The power of reflection and the power of cultivation. And what, monks, is the power of reflection? Here, monks, someone reflects thus: 'Bodily misconduct has a bad result in this very life and in the life to come; verbal misconduct has a bad result in this very life and in the life to come; mental misconduct has a bad result in this very life and in the life to come.' Reflecting thus, one abandons bodily misconduct and develops bodily good conduct; one abandons verbal misconduct and develops verbal good conduct; one abandons mental misconduct and develops mental good conduct; one maintains oneself in purity. This, monks, is called the power of reflection."

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, bhāvanābalaṃ. Tatra, bhikkhave, yamidaṃ [yadidaṃ (sī.)] bhāvanābalaṃ sekhānametaṃ [sekhametaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ.)] balaṃ. Sekhañhi so, bhikkhave, balaṃ āgamma rāgaṃ pajahati, dosaṃ pajahati, mohaṃ pajahati. Rāgaṃ pahāya, dosaṃ pahāya, mohaṃ pahāya yaṃ akusalaṃ na taṃ karoti, yaṃ pāpaṃ na taṃ sevati. Idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, bhāvanābalaṃ. Imāni kho, bhikkhave, dve balānī’’ti.

"And what, monks, is the power of cultivation? In this case, monks, this power of cultivation is the power of the trainees. For, monks, it is by relying on this power that a trainee abandons lust, abandons hate, abandons delusion. Having abandoned lust, hate, and delusion, one does not do what is unwholesome, nor cultivate what is evil. This, monks, is called the power of cultivation. These, monks, are the two powers."
