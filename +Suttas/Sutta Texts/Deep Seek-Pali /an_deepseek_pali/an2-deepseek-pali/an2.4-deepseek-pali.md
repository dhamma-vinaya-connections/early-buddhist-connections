# AN 2.4 Atapanīyasuttaṃ
## AN 2.4 The Discourse on the Not-to-be-Repented

4. ‘‘Dveme, bhikkhave, dhammā atapanīyā. Katame dve? Idha, bhikkhave, ekaccassa kāyasucaritaṃ kataṃ hoti, akataṃ hoti kāyaduccaritaṃ; vacīsucaritaṃ kataṃ hoti, akataṃ hoti vacīduccaritaṃ; manosucaritaṃ kataṃ hoti, akataṃ hoti manoduccaritaṃ. So ‘kāyasucaritaṃ me kata’nti na tappati, ‘akataṃ me kāyaduccarita’nti na tappati; ‘vacīsucaritaṃ me kata’nti na tappati, ‘akataṃ me vacīduccarita’nti na tappati; ‘manosucaritaṃ me kata’nti na tappati, ‘akataṃ me manoduccarita’nti na tappati. Ime kho, bhikkhave, dve dhammā atapanīyā’’ti. Catutthaṃ.

4. Bhikkhus, these two things are not to be repented. What two? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person has performed wholesome bodily action and has not performed unwholesome bodily action; has performed wholesome verbal action and has not performed unwholesome verbal action; has performed wholesome mental action and has not performed unwholesome mental action. He does not feel remorse thinking, ‘I have performed wholesome bodily action,’ nor does he feel remorse thinking, ‘I have not performed unwholesome bodily action.’ He does not feel remorse thinking, ‘I have performed wholesome verbal action,’ nor does he feel remorse thinking, ‘I have not performed unwholesome verbal action.’ He does not feel remorse thinking, ‘I have performed wholesome mental action,’ nor does he feel remorse thinking, ‘I have not performed unwholesome mental action.’ These, bhikkhus, are the two things that are not to be repented. The fourth.
