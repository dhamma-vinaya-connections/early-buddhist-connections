# AN 2.36

36. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One, and after approaching, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, how many are worthy of offerings in the world, and where should a gift be given?" "Householder, there are two who are worthy of offerings in the world: one in training and one beyond training. These two, householder, are worthy of offerings in the world, and gifts should be given to them."

Idamavoca bhagavā. Idaṃ vatvāna [vatvā (sī. pī.) evamīdisesu ṭhānesu] sugato athāparaṃ etadavoca satthā –

The Blessed One said this. Having said this, the Sugata, the Teacher, then added:

‘‘Sekho asekho ca imasmiṃ loke,Āhuneyyā yajamānānaṃ honti;Te ujjubhūtā [ujubhūtā (syā. kaṃ. ka.)] kāyena, vācāya uda cetasā;Khettaṃ taṃ yajamānānaṃ, ettha dinnaṃ mahapphala’’nti.

One in training and one beyond training in this world are worthy of offerings from those who sacrifice. They are upright in body, speech, and mind. That is the field for those who sacrifice; what is given here yields great fruit.
