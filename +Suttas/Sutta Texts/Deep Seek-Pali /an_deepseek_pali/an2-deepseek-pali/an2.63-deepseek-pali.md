# AN 2.63

63.“Monks, I will teach you about association with the unrighteous and association with the righteous. Listen to it, attend carefully; I will speak.” “Yes, Venerable Sir,” those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, asantasannivāso hoti, kathañca asanto sannivasanti? Idha, bhikkhave, therassa bhikkhuno evaṃ hoti – ‘theropi maṃ na vadeyya, majjhimopi maṃ na vadeyya, navopi maṃ na vadeyya; therampāhaṃ na vadeyyaṃ, majjhimampāhaṃ na vadeyyaṃ, navampāhaṃ na vadeyyaṃ. Thero cepi maṃ vadeyya ahitānukampī maṃ vadeyya no hitānukampī, noti naṃ vadeyyaṃ viheṭheyyaṃ [viheseyyaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] passampissa nappaṭikareyyaṃ. Majjhimo cepi maṃ vadeyya…pe… navo cepi maṃ vadeyya ahitānukampī maṃ vadeyya no hitānukampī, noti naṃ vadeyyaṃ viheṭheyyaṃ passampissa nappaṭikareyyaṃ’. Majjhimassapi bhikkhuno evaṃ hoti…pe… navassapi bhikkhuno evaṃ hoti – ‘theropi maṃ na vadeyya, majjhimopi maṃ na vadeyya, navopi maṃ na vadeyya; therampāhaṃ na vadeyyaṃ, majjhimampāhaṃ na vadeyyaṃ, navampāhaṃ na vadeyyaṃ. Thero cepi maṃ vadeyya ahitānukampī maṃ vadeyya no hitānukampī noti naṃ vadeyyaṃ viheṭheyyaṃ passampissa nappaṭikareyyaṃ. Majjhimo cepi maṃ vadeyya…pe… navo cepi maṃ vadeyya ahitānukampī maṃ vadeyya no hitānukampī, noti naṃ vadeyyaṃ viheṭheyyaṃ passampissa nappaṭikareyyaṃ’. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, asantasannivāso hoti, evañca asanto sannivasanti.

“And how, monks, is there association with the unrighteous, and how do the unrighteous associate? Here, monks, a senior monk thinks thus: ‘Let neither a senior monk admonish me, nor a middle-ranking monk, nor a junior monk. And I will not admonish a senior monk, nor a middle-ranking monk, nor a junior monk. If a senior monk admonishes me, he does so wishing ill, not wishing well—I would say to him, “I will not do what you say,” I would harass him, and even if I see it, I would not comply with him.’ A middle-ranking monk also thinks thus… A junior monk also thinks thus: ‘Let neither a senior monk admonish me, nor a middle-ranking monk, nor a junior monk. And I will not admonish a senior monk, nor a middle-ranking monk, nor a junior monk. If a senior monk admonishes me, he does so wishing ill, not wishing well—I would say to him, “I will not do what you say,” I would harass him, and even if I see it, I would not comply with him.’ A middle-ranking monk also thinks thus… A junior monk also thinks thus: ‘If a senior monk admonishes me, he does so wishing ill, not wishing well—I would say to him, “I will not do what you say,” I would harass him, and even if I see it, I would not comply with him.’ Thus, monks, there is association with the unrighteous, and thus do the unrighteous associate.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, santasannivāso hoti, kathañca santo sannivasanti? Idha, bhikkhave, therassa bhikkhuno evaṃ hoti – ‘theropi maṃ vadeyya, majjhimopi maṃ vadeyya, navopi maṃ vadeyya; therampāhaṃ vadeyyaṃ, majjhimampāhaṃ vadeyyaṃ, navampāhaṃ vadeyyaṃ. Thero cepi maṃ vadeyya hitānukampī maṃ vadeyya no ahitānukampī, sādhūti naṃ vadeyyaṃ na viheṭheyyaṃ passampissa paṭikareyyaṃ. Majjhimo cepi maṃ vadeyya…pe… navo cepi maṃ vadeyya hitānukampī maṃ vadeyya no ahitānukampī, sādhūti naṃ vadeyyaṃ na naṃ viheṭheyyaṃ passampissa paṭikareyyaṃ’.

Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, santasannivāso hoti, evañca santo sannivasantī’’ti.
