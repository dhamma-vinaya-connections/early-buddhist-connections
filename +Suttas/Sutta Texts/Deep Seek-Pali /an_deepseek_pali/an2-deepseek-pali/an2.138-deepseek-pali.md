In which two? Towards the Tathāgata and towards the Tathāgata’s disciples. Monks, behaving wrongly in these two respects, a foolish, unskilled, unrighteous person maintains a wounded and injured self, is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise, and generates much demerit."

Tathāgate ca tathāgatasāvake ca.
