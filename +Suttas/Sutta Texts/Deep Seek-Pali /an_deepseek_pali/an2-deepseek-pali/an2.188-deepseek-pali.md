# AN 2.188

188."Monks, one endowed with two qualities is deposited in heaven as if carried there. Which two? Non-anger and non-resentment... non-denigration and non-domineering... non-envy and non-stinginess... non-deceit and non-trickery... shame and moral dread. Endowed with these two qualities, monks, one is deposited in heaven as if carried there."
