# AN 2.19

19. "Bhikkhus, abandon the unwholesome. Bhikkhus, it is possible to abandon the unwholesome. If it were not possible, bhikkhus, to abandon the unwholesome, I would not say: ‘Bhikkhus, abandon the unwholesome.’ But because, bhikkhus, it is possible to abandon the unwholesome, I say: ‘Bhikkhus, abandon the unwholesome.’ And if, bhikkhus, abandoning the unwholesome led to harm and suffering, I would not say: ‘Bhikkhus, abandon the unwholesome.’ But because, bhikkhus, abandoning the unwholesome leads to benefit and happiness, I say: ‘Bhikkhus, abandon the unwholesome.’"

‘‘Kusalaṃ, bhikkhave, bhāvetha. Sakkā, bhikkhave, kusalaṃ bhāvetuṃ. No cedaṃ, bhikkhave, sakkā abhavissa kusalaṃ bhāvetuṃ, nāhaṃ evaṃ vadeyyaṃ – ‘kusalaṃ, bhikkhave, bhāvethā’ti. Yasmā ca kho, bhikkhave, sakkā kusalaṃ bhāvetuṃ tasmāhaṃ evaṃ vadāmi – ‘kusalaṃ, bhikkhave, bhāvethā’ti. Kusalañca hidaṃ, bhikkhave, bhāvitaṃ ahitāya dukkhāya saṃvatteyya, nāhaṃ evaṃ vadeyyaṃ – ‘kusalaṃ, bhikkhave, bhāvethā’ti. Yasmā ca kho, bhikkhave, kusalaṃ bhāvitaṃ hitāya sukhāya saṃvattati tasmāhaṃ evaṃ vadāmi – ‘kusalaṃ, bhikkhave, bhāvethā’’’ti.

"Develop what is wholesome, monks. It is possible, monks, to develop what is wholesome. If it were not possible, monks, to develop what is wholesome, I would not say: ‘Develop what is wholesome, monks.’ But because, monks, it is possible to develop what is wholesome, I say: ‘Develop what is wholesome, monks.’ And if, monks, developing what is wholesome led to harm and suffering, I would not say: ‘Develop what is wholesome, monks.’ But because, monks, developing what is wholesome leads to benefit and happiness, I say: ‘Develop what is wholesome, monks.’"
