# AN 2.15

15. "Monks, in any dispute where both the accused monk and the accusing monk do not properly examine themselves, that dispute can be expected to lead to lengthiness, harshness, and strife, and the monks will not dwell at ease. But in any dispute where both the accused monk and the accusing monk do properly examine themselves, that dispute can be expected not to lead to lengthiness, harshness, or strife, and the monks will dwell at ease."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, āpanno bhikkhu sādhukaṃ attanāva attānaṃ paccavekkhati? Idha, bhikkhave, āpanno bhikkhu iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘ahaṃ kho akusalaṃ āpanno kañcideva [kiñcideva (ka.)] desaṃ kāyena. Maṃ so [tasmā maṃ so (sī. syā.)] bhikkhu addasa akusalaṃ āpajjamānaṃ kiñcideva desaṃ kāyena. No ce ahaṃ akusalaṃ āpajjeyyaṃ kiñcideva desaṃ kāyena, na maṃ so bhikkhu passeyya akusalaṃ āpajjamānaṃ kiñcideva desaṃ kāyena. Yasmā ca kho, ahaṃ akusalaṃ āpanno kiñcideva desaṃ kāyena, tasmā maṃ so bhikkhu addasa akusalaṃ āpajjamānaṃ kiñcideva desaṃ kāyena. Disvā ca pana maṃ so bhikkhu akusalaṃ āpajjamānaṃ kiñcideva desaṃ kāyena anattamano ahosi. Anattamano samāno anattamanavacanaṃ [anattamanavācaṃ (ka.)] maṃ so bhikkhu avaca. Anattamanavacanāhaṃ [anattamanavācaṃ nāhaṃ (ka.)] tena bhikkhunā vutto samāno anattamano [attamano (ka.)] ahosiṃ. Anattamano samāno paresaṃ ārocesiṃ. Iti mameva tattha accayo accagamā suṅkadāyakaṃva bhaṇḍasminti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, āpanno bhikkhu sādhukaṃ attanāva attānaṃ paccavekkhati.

"And how, monks, does a monk under accusation properly examine himself by himself? Here, monks, a monk under accusation reflects thus: 'I have committed a certain offense through body. That monk saw me committing a certain offense through body. If I had not committed a certain offense through body, that monk would not have seen me committing a certain offense through body. But because I did commit a certain offense through body, therefore that monk saw me committing a certain offense through body. And having seen me committing a certain offense through body, that monk was displeased. Being displeased, that monk spoke to me with displeased words. Being spoken to with displeased words by that monk, I became displeased. Being displeased, I told others. Thus, the fault there has redounded to me alone, just as it redounds to one liable for customs duty on goods.' In this way, monks, a monk under accusation properly examines himself by himself."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, codako bhikkhu sādhukaṃ attanāva attānaṃ paccavekkhati? Idha, bhikkhave, codako bhikkhu iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘ayaṃ kho bhikkhu akusalaṃ āpanno kiñcideva desaṃ kāyena. Ahaṃ imaṃ bhikkhuṃ addasaṃ akusalaṃ āpajjamānaṃ kiñcideva desaṃ kāyena. No ce ayaṃ bhikkhu akusalaṃ āpajjeyya kiñcideva desaṃ kāyena, nāhaṃ imaṃ bhikkhuṃ passeyyaṃ akusalaṃ āpajjamānaṃ kiñcideva desaṃ kāyena. Yasmā ca kho, ayaṃ bhikkhu akusalaṃ āpanno kiñcideva desaṃ kāyena, tasmā ahaṃ imaṃ bhikkhuṃ addasaṃ akusalaṃ āpajjamānaṃ kiñcideva desaṃ kāyena. Disvā ca panāhaṃ imaṃ bhikkhuṃ akusalaṃ āpajjamānaṃ kiñcideva desaṃ kāyena anattamano ahosiṃ. Anattamano samāno anattamanavacanāhaṃ imaṃ bhikkhuṃ avacaṃ. Anattamanavacanāyaṃ bhikkhu mayā vutto samāno anattamano ahosi. Anattamano samāno paresaṃ ārocesi. Iti mameva tattha accayo accagamā suṅkadāyakaṃva bhaṇḍasminti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, codako bhikkhu sādhukaṃ attanāva attānaṃ paccavekkhati.

"And how, monks, does an accusing monk properly examine himself by himself? Here, monks, an accusing monk reflects thus: 'This monk has committed a certain offense through body. I saw this monk committing a certain offense through body. If this monk had not committed a certain offense through body, I would not have seen this monk committing a certain offense through body. But because this monk did commit a certain offense through body, therefore I saw this monk committing a certain offense through body. And having seen this monk committing a certain offense through body, I became displeased. Being displeased, I spoke to this monk with displeased words. Being spoken to with displeased words by me, this monk became displeased. Being displeased, he informed others. Thus, the fault there has redounded to me alone, just as it redounds to one liable for customs duty on goods.' In this way, monks, an accusing monk properly examines himself by himself."

‘‘Yasmiṃ, bhikkhave, adhikaraṇe āpanno ca bhikkhu codako ca bhikkhu na sādhukaṃ attanāva attānaṃ paccavekkhati tasmetaṃ, bhikkhave, adhikaraṇe pāṭikaṅkhaṃ dīghattāya kharattāya vāḷattāya saṃvattissati, bhikkhū ca na phāsuṃ viharissantīti. Yasmiñca kho, bhikkhave, adhikaraṇe āpanno ca bhikkhu codako ca bhikkhu sādhukaṃ attanāva attānaṃ paccavekkhati tasmetaṃ, bhikkhave, adhikaraṇe pāṭikaṅkhaṃ na dīghattāya kharattāya vāḷattāya saṃvattissati, bhikkhū ca phāsu viharissantī’’ti.

"Monks, in any dispute where the accused monk and the accusing monk do not properly examine themselves, that dispute, monks, can be expected to lead to lengthiness, harshness, and acrimony, and the monks will not live at ease. But in any dispute where the accused monk and the accusing monk do properly examine themselves, that dispute, monks, can be expected not to lead to lengthiness, harshness, or acrimony, and the monks will live at ease."
