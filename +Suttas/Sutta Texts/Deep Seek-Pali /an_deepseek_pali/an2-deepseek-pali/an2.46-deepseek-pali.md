# AN 2.46

46.“Monks, there are these two assemblies. Which two? An ignoble assembly and a noble assembly. And what, monks, is an ignoble assembly? Here, monks, in whatever assembly monks do not understand as it really is: ‘This is suffering,’ do not understand as it really is: ‘This is the origin of suffering,’ do not understand as it really is: ‘This is the cessation of suffering,’ do not understand as it really is: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’ This, monks, is called an ignoble assembly.

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, ariyā parisā? Idha, bhikkhave, yassaṃ parisāyaṃ bhikkhū ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānanti, ‘ayaṃ dukkhasamudayo’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānanti, ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodho’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānanti, ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānanti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, ariyā parisā. Imā kho, bhikkhave, dve parisā. Etadaggaṃ, bhikkhave, imāsaṃ dvinnaṃ parisānaṃ yadidaṃ ariyā parisā’’ti.

“And what, monks, is a noble assembly? Here, monks, in whatever assembly the monks understand as it really is: ‘This is suffering’; understand as it really is: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; understand as it really is: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; understand as it really is: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’ This, monks, is called a noble assembly. These, monks, are the two kinds of assemblies. Of these two assemblies, monks, a noble assembly is the foremost.”
