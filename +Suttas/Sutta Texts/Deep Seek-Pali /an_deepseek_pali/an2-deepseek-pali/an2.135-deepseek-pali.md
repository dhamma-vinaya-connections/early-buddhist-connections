# AN 2.135

135."Monks, a foolish, unskilled, unrighteous person, endowed with two qualities, maintains a wounded and injured self, is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise, and generates much demerit. What are the two? Without investigating and thoroughly examining, they speak praise of one deserving dispraise; without investigating and thoroughly examining, they speak dispraise of one deserving praise. These, monks, are the two qualities."

‘‘Dvīhi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato paṇḍito viyatto sappuriso akkhataṃ anupahataṃ attānaṃ pariharati, anavajjo ca hoti ananuvajjo ca viññūnaṃ, bahuñca puññaṃ pasavati. Katamehi dvīhi? Anuvicca pariyogāhetvā avaṇṇārahassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati, anuvicca pariyogāhetvā vaṇṇārahassa vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, dvīhi dhammehi samannāgato paṇḍito viyatto sappuriso akkhataṃ anupahataṃ attānaṃ pariharati, anavajjo ca hoti ananuvajjo ca viññūnaṃ, bahuñca puññaṃ pasavatī’’ti.

"Monks, a wise, discerning, righteous person, endowed with two qualities, maintains an unwounded and uninjured self, is blameless and irreproachable by the wise, and generates much merit. What are the two? After investigating and thoroughly examining, they speak dispraise of one deserving dispraise; after investigating and thoroughly examining, they speak praise of one deserving praise. These, monks, are the two qualities."
