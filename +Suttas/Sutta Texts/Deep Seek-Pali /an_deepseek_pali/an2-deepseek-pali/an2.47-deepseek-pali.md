# AN 2.47

47.“Monks, there are these two assemblies. Which two? A corrupt assembly and an excellent assembly. And what, monks, is a corrupt assembly? Here, monks, in whatever assembly monks go on the wrong course because of desire, go on the wrong course because of hatred, go on the wrong course because of delusion, go on the wrong course because of fear. This, monks, is called a corrupt assembly.

‘‘Katamo ca, bhikkhave, parisāmaṇḍo? Idha, bhikkhave, yassaṃ parisāyaṃ bhikkhū na chandāgatiṃ gacchanti, na dosāgatiṃ gacchanti, na mohāgatiṃ gacchanti, na bhayāgatiṃ gacchanti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, parisāmaṇḍo. Imā kho, bhikkhave, dve parisā. Etadaggaṃ, bhikkhave, imāsaṃ dvinnaṃ parisānaṃ yadidaṃ parisāmaṇḍo’’ti.

“And what, monks, is an excellent assembly? Here, monks, in whatever assembly the monks do not go on the wrong course because of desire, do not go on the wrong course because of hatred, do not go on the wrong course because of delusion, do not go on the wrong course because of fear. This, monks, is called an excellent assembly. These, monks, are the two assemblies. Of these two assemblies, monks, an excellent assembly is the foremost.”
