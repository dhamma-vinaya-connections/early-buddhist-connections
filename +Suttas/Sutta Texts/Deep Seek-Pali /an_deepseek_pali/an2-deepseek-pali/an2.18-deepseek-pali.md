# AN 2.18

18. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. As the Venerable Ānanda was sitting to one side, the Blessed One said to him: "Ānanda, I declare that misconduct by body, speech, and mind is absolutely not to be done.""Venerable sir, when this misconduct by body, speech, and mind—declared by the Blessed One as absolutely not to be done—is being done, what danger is to be expected?""Ānanda, when this misconduct by body, speech, and mind—declared by me as absolutely not to be done—is being done, this danger is to be expected: one blames oneself, the wise, having investigated, censure one, an evil reputation spreads, one dies confused, and after death, with the breakup of the body, one is reborn in a state of misery, a bad destination, the lower realms, even in hell. Ānanda, when this misconduct by body, speech, and mind—declared by me as absolutely not to be done—is being done, this danger is to be expected."

‘‘Ekaṃsenāhaṃ, ānanda, karaṇīyaṃ vadāmi kāyasucaritaṃ vacīsucaritaṃ manosucarita’’nti. ‘‘Yamidaṃ, bhante, bhagavatā ekaṃsena karaṇīyaṃ akkhātaṃ kāyasucaritaṃ vacīsucaritaṃ manosucaritaṃ tasmiṃ karaṇīye kayiramāne ko ānisaṃso pāṭikaṅkho’’ti? ‘‘Yamidaṃ, ānanda, mayā ekaṃsena karaṇīyaṃ akkhātaṃ kāyasucaritaṃ vacīsucaritaṃ manosucaritaṃ tasmiṃ karaṇīye kayiramāne ayaṃ ānisaṃso pāṭikaṅkho – attāpi attānaṃ na upavadati, anuvicca viññū pasaṃsanti, kalyāṇo kittisaddo abbhuggacchati, asammūḷho kālaṃ karoti, kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjati. Yamidaṃ, ānanda, mayā ekaṃsena karaṇīyaṃ akkhātaṃ kāyasucaritaṃ vacīsucaritaṃ manosucaritaṃ tasmiṃ karaṇīye kayiramāne ayaṃ ānisaṃso pāṭikaṅkho’’ti.

"Ānanda, I declare that good conduct by body, speech, and mind is absolutely to be done." "Venerable sir, when this good conduct by body, speech, and mind—declared by the Blessed One as absolutely to be done—is being done, what benefit is to be expected?" "Ānanda, when this good conduct by body, speech, and mind—declared by me as absolutely to be done—is being done, this benefit is to be expected: one does not blame oneself, the wise, having investigated, praise one, a good reputation spreads, one dies unconfused, and after death, with the breakup of the body, one is reborn in a good destination, a heavenly world. Ānanda, when this good conduct by body, speech, and mind—declared by me as absolutely to be done—is being done, this benefit is to be expected."
