# AN 4.42 Pañhabyākaraṇasuttaṃ

## AN 4.42 The Discourse on Answering Questions

42. ‘‘Cattārimāni, bhikkhave, pañhabyākaraṇāni [pañhābyākaraṇāni (ka.)]. Katamāni cattāri? Atthi, bhikkhave, pañho ekaṃsabyākaraṇīyo; atthi, bhikkhave, pañho vibhajjabyākaraṇīyo; atthi, bhikkhave, pañho paṭipucchābyākaraṇīyo; atthi, bhikkhave, pañho ṭhapanīyo. Imāni kho, bhikkhave, cattāri pañhabyākaraṇānī’’ti.

42."Monks, there are these four ways of answering questions. What four? There is, monks, a question to be answered categorically; there is a question to be answered analytically; there is a question to be answered by a counter-question; there is a question to be put aside. These, monks, are the four ways of answering questions."

‘‘Ekaṃsavacanaṃ ekaṃ, vibhajjavacanāparaṃ;Tatiyaṃ paṭipuccheyya, catutthaṃ pana ṭhāpaye.

"One is to be answered categorically, another analytically; a third should be answered by a counter-question, and the fourth should be put aside."

‘‘Yo ca tesaṃ [nesaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ.)] tattha tattha, jānāti anudhammataṃ;Catupañhassa kusalo, āhu bhikkhuṃ tathāvidhaṃ.

"And one who knows, in each case, the proper way to answer them, skilled in the four kinds of questions: they call a bhikkhu such as that."

‘‘Durāsado duppasaho, gambhīro duppadhaṃsiyo;Atho atthe anatthe ca, ubhayassa hoti kovido [ubhayatthassa kovido (syā. kaṃ.)].

"Hard to assail, hard to overcome, profound, difficult to dislodge; and skilled in both what is beneficial and what is not beneficial."

‘‘Anatthaṃ parivajjeti, atthaṃ gaṇhāti paṇḍito;Atthābhisamayā dhīro, paṇḍitoti pavuccatī’’ti. dutiyaṃ;

"The wise one avoids what is not beneficial, and takes up what is beneficial; through the realization of the goal, the resolute one is called wise." The Second.
