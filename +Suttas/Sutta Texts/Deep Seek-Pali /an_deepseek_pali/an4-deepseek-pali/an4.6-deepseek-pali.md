# AN 4.6 Appassutasuttaṃ

## AN 4.6 The Discourse on One with Little Learning

6. ‘‘Cattārome, bhikkhave, puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ. Katame cattāro? Appassuto sutena anupapanno, appassuto sutena upapanno, bahussuto sutena anupapanno, bahussuto sutena upapanno. Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo appassuto hoti sutena anupapanno? Idha, bhikkhave, ekaccassa puggalassa appakaṃ sutaṃ hoti – suttaṃ geyyaṃ veyyākaraṇaṃ gāthā udānaṃ itivuttakaṃ jātakaṃ abbhutadhammaṃ vedallaṃ. So tassa appakassa sutassa na atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya [na dhammamaññāya (pī. ka.)] dhammānudhammappaṭipanno hoti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo appassuto hoti sutena anupapanno.

6. "Monks, these four types of individuals are found existing in the world. Which four? One of little learning who has not attained to conformity with learning; one of little learning who has attained to conformity with learning; one of much learning who has not attained to conformity with learning; and one of much learning who has attained to conformity with learning. And how, monks, is an individual one of little learning who has not attained to conformity with learning? Here, monks, a certain individual has learned little—suttas, geyyas, veyyākaraṇas, gāthās, udānas, itivuttakas, jātakas, abbhutadhammas, and vedallas. He does not, by comprehending the meaning and by comprehending the Dhamma of that little learning of his, live in conformity with the Dhamma. It is in this way, monks, that an individual is one of little learning who has not attained to conformity with learning.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo appassuto hoti sutena upapanno? Idha, bhikkhave, ekaccassa puggalassa appakaṃ sutaṃ hoti – suttaṃ geyyaṃ veyyākaraṇaṃ gāthā udānaṃ itivuttakaṃ jātakaṃ abbhutadhammaṃ vedallaṃ. So tassa appakassa sutassa atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya dhammānudhammappaṭipanno hoti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo appassuto hoti sutena upapanno.

He, by comprehending the meaning and by comprehending the Dhamma of that little learning of his, lives in conformity with the Dhamma. It is in this way, monks, that an individual is one of little learning who has attained to conformity with learning."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo bahussuto hoti sutena anupapanno? Idha, bhikkhave, ekaccassa puggalassa bahukaṃ sutaṃ hoti – suttaṃ geyyaṃ veyyākaraṇaṃ gāthā udānaṃ itivuttakaṃ jātakaṃ abbhutadhammaṃ vedallaṃ. So tassa bahukassa sutassa na atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya [na dhammamaññāya (pī.)] dhammānudhammappaṭipanno hoti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo bahussuto hoti sutena anupapanno.

"And how, monks, is an individual one of much learning who has not attained to conformity with learning? Here, monks, a certain individual has learned much—suttas, geyyas, veyyākaraṇas, gāthās, udānas, itivuttakas, jātakas, abbhutadhammas, and vedallas. He does not, by comprehending the meaning and by comprehending the Dhamma of that much learning of his, live in conformity with the Dhamma. It is in this way, monks, that an individual is one of much learning who has not attained to conformity with learning."

Ime kho, bhikkhave, cattāro puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmi’’nti.

‘‘Appassutopi ce hoti, sīlesu asamāhito;Ubhayena naṃ garahanti, sīlato ca sutena ca.

Even if he is of little learning, but is unestablished in virtue,
They reproach him on both counts: for his virtue and for his learning.

‘‘Appassutopi ce hoti, sīlesu susamāhito;Sīlato naṃ pasaṃsanti, tassa sampajjate sutaṃ.

Even if he is of little learning, but is well-established in virtue,
They praise him for his virtue, and his learning comes to fruition.

‘‘Bahussutopi ce hoti, sīlesu asamāhito;Sīlato naṃ garahanti, nāssa sampajjate sutaṃ.

Even if he is of much learning, but is unestablished in virtue,
They reproach him for his virtue, and his learning does not come to fruition.

‘‘Bahussutopi ce hoti, sīlesu susamāhito;Ubhayena naṃ pasaṃsanti, sīlato ca sutena ca.

Even if he is of much learning, well-established in virtue,
They praise him on both counts: for his virtue and for his learning.

‘‘Bahussutaṃ dhammadharaṃ, sappaññaṃ buddhasāvakaṃ;Nekkhaṃ jambonadasseva, ko taṃ ninditumarahati;Devāpi naṃ pasaṃsanti, brahmunāpi pasaṃsito’’ti. chaṭṭhaṃ;

One who has heard much, a bearer of the Dhamma,
Wise, a disciple of the Buddha—
Like pure Jambū gold,
Who is fit to blame such a one?
Even the devas praise him,
And by Brahmā too he is praised.
Sixth.
