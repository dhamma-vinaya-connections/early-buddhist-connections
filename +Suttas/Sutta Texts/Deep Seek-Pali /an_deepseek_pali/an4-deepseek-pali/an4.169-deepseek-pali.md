## AN 4.169 Sasaṅkhāra Sutta: With Exertion

169. ‘‘Cattārome, bhikkhave, puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ. Katame cattāro? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo diṭṭheva dhamme sasaṅkhāraparinibbāyī hoti. Idha pana, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo kāyassa bhedā sasaṅkhāraparinibbāyī hoti. Idha pana, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo diṭṭheva dhamme asaṅkhāraparinibbāyī hoti. Idha pana, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo kāyassa bhedā asaṅkhāraparinibbāyī hoti.

169.Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world. What four? Here, monks, a certain person attains final Nibbāna with exertion in this very life. Here, monks, a certain person attains final Nibbāna with exertion after the breakup of the body. Here, monks, a certain person attains final Nibbāna without exertion in this very life. Here, monks, a certain person attains final Nibbāna without exertion after the breakup of the body.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo diṭṭheva dhamme sasaṅkhāraparinibbāyī hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu asubhānupassī kāye viharati, āhāre paṭikūlasaññī, sabbaloke anabhiratisaññī, sabbasaṅkhāresu aniccānupassī. Maraṇasaññā kho panassa ajjhattaṃ sūpaṭṭhitā hoti. So imāni pañca sekhabalāni upanissāya viharati – saddhābalaṃ, hiribalaṃ, ottappabalaṃ, vīriyabalaṃ, paññābalaṃ. Tassimāni pañcindriyāni adhimattāni pātubhavanti – saddhindriyaṃ, vīriyindriyaṃ, satindriyaṃ, samādhindriyaṃ, paññindriyaṃ. So imesaṃ pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ adhimattattā diṭṭheva dhamme sasaṅkhāraparinibbāyī hoti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo diṭṭheva dhamme sasaṅkhāraparinibbāyī hoti.

And how, monks, is a person one who attains final Nibbāna with exertion in this very life? Here, monks, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the foulness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness in food, perceiving dissatisfaction with the entire world, contemplating impermanence in all formations. Moreover, the perception of death is well established in him internally. He dwells relying on these five powers of one in training—the power of faith, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom. These five faculties appear in him in an exceeding measure—the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties are in exceeding measure in him, he attains final Nibbāna with exertion in this very life. Thus, monks, a person is one who attains final Nibbāna with exertion in this very life.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo kāyassa bhedā sasaṅkhāraparinibbāyī hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu asubhānupassī kāye viharati, āhāre paṭikūlasaññī, sabbaloke anabhiratisaññī, sabbasaṅkhāresu aniccānupassī. Maraṇasaññā kho panassa ajjhattaṃ sūpaṭṭhitā hoti. So imāni pañca sekhabalāni upanissāya viharati – saddhābalaṃ, hiribalaṃ, ottappabalaṃ, vīriyabalaṃ, paññābalaṃ. Tassimāni pañcindriyāni mudūni pātubhavanti – saddhindriyaṃ, vīriyindriyaṃ, satindriyaṃ, samādhindriyaṃ, paññindriyaṃ. So imesaṃ pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ muduttā kāyassa bhedā sasaṅkhāraparinibbāyī hoti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo kāyassa bhedā sasaṅkhāraparinibbāyī hoti.

And how, monks, is a person one who attains final Nibbāna with exertion after the breakup of the body? Here, monks, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the foulness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness in food, perceiving dissatisfaction with the entire world, contemplating impermanence in all formations. Moreover, the perception of death is well established in him internally. He dwells relying on these five powers of one in training—the power of faith, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom. These five faculties appear in him in a mild measure—the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties are in a mild measure in him, he attains final Nibbāna with exertion after the breakup of the body. Thus, monks, a person is one who attains final Nibbāna with exertion after the breakup of the body.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo diṭṭheva dhamme asaṅkhāraparinibbāyī hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vivicceva kāmehi…pe… paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ…pe… dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ…pe… tatiyaṃ jhānaṃ…pe… catutthaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati. So imāni pañca sekhabalāni upanissāya viharati – saddhābalaṃ…pe… paññābalaṃ. Tassimāni pañcindriyāni adhimattāni pātubhavanti – saddhindriyaṃ…pe… paññindriyaṃ. So imesaṃ pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ adhimattattā diṭṭheva dhamme asaṅkhāraparinibbāyī hoti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo diṭṭheva dhamme asaṅkhāraparinibbāyī hoti.

And how, monks, is a person one who attains final Nibbāna without exertion in this very life? Here, monks, a bhikkhu, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by applied thought and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion; with the subsiding of applied thought and sustained thought, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without applied thought and sustained thought, and is filled with rapture and pleasure born of concentration; with the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and mindful and clearly comprehending, and experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna, of which the noble ones declare: ‘He dwells equanimous and mindful, one who has a pleasant abiding’; with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is neither painful nor pleasant and includes the purification of mindfulness by equanimity. He dwells relying on these five powers of one in training—the power of faith, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom. These five faculties appear in him in an exceeding measure—the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties are in exceeding measure in him, he attains final Nibbāna without exertion in this very life. Thus, monks, a person is one who attains final Nibbāna without exertion in this very life.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo kāyassa bhedā asaṅkhāraparinibbāyī hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vivicceva kāmehi…pe… paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ…pe… dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ…pe… tatiyaṃ jhānaṃ…pe… catutthaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati. So imāni pañca sekhabalāni upanissāya viharati – saddhābalaṃ, hiribalaṃ, ottappabalaṃ, vīriyabalaṃ, paññābalaṃ. Tassimāni pañcindriyāni…pe… paññindriyaṃ. So imesaṃ pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ muduttā kāyassa bhedā asaṅkhāraparinibbāyī hoti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo kāyassa bhedā asaṅkhāraparinibbāyī hoti. Ime kho, bhikkhave, cattāro puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmi’’nti. Navamaṃ.
