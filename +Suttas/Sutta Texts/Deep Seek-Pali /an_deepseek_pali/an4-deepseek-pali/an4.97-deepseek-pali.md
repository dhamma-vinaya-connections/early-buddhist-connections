## AN 4.97 The Discourse on Quick Comprehension

97. ‘‘Cattārome, bhikkhave, puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ. Katame cattāro? Attahitāya paṭipanno no parahitāya, parahitāya paṭipanno no attahitāya, nevattahitāya paṭipanno no parahitāya, attahitāya ceva paṭipanno parahitāya ca.

97.“Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world. Which four? One who practices for his own benefit but not for the benefit of others, one who practices for the benefit of others but not for his own benefit, one who practices neither for his own benefit nor for the benefit of others, and one who practices both for his own benefit and for the benefit of others.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo attahitāya paṭipanno hoti, no parahitāya? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo khippanisantī ca hoti kusalesu dhammesu, sutānañca dhammānaṃ dhārakajātiko [dhāraṇajātiko (ka.)] hoti, dhātānañca [dhatānañca (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] dhammānaṃ atthūpaparikkhī hoti atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya, dhammānudhammappaṭipanno hoti; no ca kalyāṇavāco hoti kalyāṇavākkaraṇo poriyā vācāya samannāgato vissaṭṭhāya anelagalāya atthassa viññāpaniyā, no ca sandassako hoti samādapako [samādāpako (?)] samuttejako sampahaṃsako sabrahmacārīnaṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo attahitāya paṭipanno hoti, no parahitāya.

“And how, monks, is a person one who practices for his own benefit but not for the benefit of others? Here, monks, a certain person is quick in comprehending wholesome states, is by nature one who retains the teachings he has heard, examines the meaning of the states he has retained, having understood the meaning and the Dhamma, and practices in conformity with the Dhamma. But he is not of good speech, a good speaker, nor is he endowed with polished speech, distinct, unhesitating, capable of making the meaning understood, nor is he an instructor, an encourager, an inspirer, and a gladdener of his fellow practitioners. It is in this way, monks, that a person practices for his own benefit but not for the benefit of others.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo parahitāya paṭipanno hoti, no attahitāya? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo na heva kho khippanisantī hoti kusalesu dhammesu, no ca sutānaṃ dhammānaṃ dhārakajātiko hoti, no ca dhātānaṃ dhammānaṃ atthūpaparikkhī hoti, no ca atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya dhammānudhammappaṭipanno hoti; kalyāṇavāco ca hoti kalyāṇavākkaraṇo poriyā vācāya samannāgato vissaṭṭhāya anelagalāya atthassa viññāpaniyā, sandassako ca hoti samādapako samuttejako sampahaṃsako sabrahmacārīnaṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo parahitāya paṭipanno hoti, no attahitāya.

“And how, monks, is a person one who practices for the benefit of others but not for his own benefit? Here, monks, a certain person is not quick in comprehending wholesome states, nor is he by nature one who retains the teachings he has heard, nor does he examine the meaning of the states he has retained, nor, having understood the meaning and the Dhamma, does he practice in conformity with the Dhamma. But he is of good speech, a good speaker, endowed with polished speech, distinct, unhesitating, capable of making the meaning understood; and he is an instructor, an encourager, an inspirer, and a gladdener of his fellow practitioners. It is in this way, monks, that a person practices for the benefit of others but not for his own benefit.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo nevattahitāya paṭipanno hoti, no parahitāya? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo na heva kho khippanisantī hoti kusalesu dhammesu, no ca sutānaṃ dhammānaṃ dhārakajātiko hoti, no ca dhātānaṃ dhammānaṃ atthūpaparikkhī hoti, no ca atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya dhammānudhammappaṭipanno hoti; no ca kalyāṇavāco hoti kalyāṇavākkaraṇo poriyā vācāya samannāgato vissaṭṭhāya anelagalāya atthassa viññāpaniyā, no ca sandassako hoti samādapako samuttejako sampahaṃsako sabrahmacārīnaṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo nevattahitāya paṭipanno hoti, no parahitāya.

Here, monks, a certain person is not quick in comprehending wholesome states, nor is he by nature one who retains the teachings he has heard, nor does he examine the meaning of the states he has retained, nor, having understood the meaning and the Dhamma, does he practice in conformity with the Dhamma; nor is he of good speech, a good speaker, nor is he endowed with polished speech, distinct, unhesitating, capable of making the meaning understood, nor is he an instructor, an encourager, an inspirer, and a gladdener of his fellow practitioners. It is in this way, monks, that a person practices neither for his own benefit nor for the benefit of others.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo attahitāya ceva paṭipanno hoti parahitāya ca? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo khippanisantī ca hoti kusalesu dhammesu, sutānañca dhammānaṃ dhārakajātiko hoti, dhātānañca dhammānaṃ atthūpaparikkhī hoti atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya, dhammānudhammappaṭipanno hoti; kalyāṇavāco ca hoti kalyāṇavākkaraṇo poriyā vācāya samannāgato vissaṭṭhāya anelagalāya atthassa viññāpaniyā, sandassako ca hoti samādapako samuttejako sampahaṃsako sabrahmacārīnaṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo attahitāya ceva paṭipanno hoti parahitāya ca. Ime kho, bhikkhave, cattāro puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmi’’nti. Sattamaṃ.
