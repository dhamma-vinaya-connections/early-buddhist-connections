# AN 4.1 Anubuddhasuttaṃ

## AN 4.1 The Comprehended

1. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā vajjīsu viharati bhaṇḍagāme. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘bhikkhavo’’ti. ‘‘Bhadante’’ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca –

1. Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjis, at Bhaṇḍagāma. There the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks!" "Venerable sir," those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

‘‘Catunnaṃ, bhikkhave, dhammānaṃ ananubodhā appaṭivedhā evamidaṃ dīghamaddhānaṃ sandhāvitaṃ saṃsaritaṃ mamañceva tumhākañca. Katamesaṃ catunnaṃ? Ariyassa, bhikkhave, sīlassa ananubodhā appaṭivedhā evamidaṃ dīghamaddhānaṃ sandhāvitaṃ saṃsaritaṃ mamañceva tumhākañca. Ariyassa, bhikkhave, samādhissa ananubodhā appaṭivedhā evamidaṃ dīghamaddhānaṃ sandhāvitaṃ saṃsaritaṃ mamañceva tumhākañca. Ariyāya, bhikkhave, paññāya ananubodhā appaṭivedhā evamidaṃ dīghamaddhānaṃ sandhāvitaṃ saṃsaritaṃ mamañceva tumhākañca. Ariyāya, bhikkhave, vimuttiyā ananubodhā appaṭivedhā evamidaṃ dīghamaddhānaṃ sandhāvitaṃ saṃsaritaṃ mamañceva tumhākañca. Tayidaṃ, bhikkhave, ariyaṃ sīlaṃ anubuddhaṃ paṭividdhaṃ, ariyo samādhi anubuddho paṭividdho, ariyā paññā anubuddhā paṭividdhā, ariyā vimutti anubuddhā paṭividdhā, ucchinnā bhavataṇhā, khīṇā bhavanetti, natthi dāni punabbhavo’’ti.

"Monks, it is because of not understanding and not penetrating four things that we have wandered through this long course of saṃsāra, both you and I. What are the four? Monks, it is because of not understanding and not penetrating the noble virtue that we have wandered through this long course of saṃsāra, both you and I. Monks, it is because of not understanding and not penetrating the noble concentration that we have wandered through this long course of saṃsāra, both you and I. Monks, it is because of not understanding and not penetrating the noble wisdom that we have wandered through this long course of saṃsāra, both you and I. Monks, it is because of not understanding and not penetrating the noble liberation that we have wandered through this long course of saṃsāra, both you and I. But now, monks, that noble virtue has been understood and penetrated, that noble concentration has been understood and penetrated, that noble wisdom has been understood and penetrated, that noble liberation has been understood and penetrated. Craving for existence has been cut off, the guide to rebirth has been destroyed; now there is no further becoming."

Idamavoca bhagavā. Idaṃ vatvāna sugato athāparaṃ etadavoca satthā –

This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, said further:

‘‘Sīlaṃ samādhi paññā ca, vimutti ca anuttarā;Anubuddhā ime dhammā, gotamena yasassinā.

"Virtue, concentration, and wisdom, and unsurpassed liberation—
These principles were awakened to by the glorious Gotama."

‘‘Iti buddho abhiññāya, dhammamakkhāsi bhikkhunaṃ;Dukkhassantakaro satthā, cakkhumā parinibbuto’’ti. paṭhamaṃ;

"Thus, the Buddha, having fully understood, taught the Dhamma to the monks; the Teacher, the ender of suffering, the one with vision, has attained final Nibbāna." This is the first.
