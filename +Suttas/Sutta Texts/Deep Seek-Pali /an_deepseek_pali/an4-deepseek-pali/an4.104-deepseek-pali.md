# AN 4.104 Udakarahadasuttaṃ

## AN 4.104 The Simile of the Water Tank

104. ‘‘Cattārome, bhikkhave, udakarahadā. Katame cattāro? Uttāno gambhīrobhāso, gambhīro uttānobhāso, uttāno uttānobhāso, gambhīro gambhīrobhāso – ime kho, bhikkhave, cattāro udakarahadā. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, cattāro udakarahadūpamā [pu. pa. 161] puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ. Katame cattāro? Uttāno gambhīrobhāso, gambhīro uttānobhāso, uttāno uttānobhāso, gambhīro gambhīrobhāso.

104.Monks, there are these four lakes. Which four? The shallow with the appearance of depth, the deep with the appearance of shallowness, the shallow with the appearance of shallowness, the deep with the appearance of depth. These, monks, are the four lakes. In the same way, monks, there are four kinds of persons comparable to lakes found existing in the world. Which four? The shallow with the appearance of depth, the deep with the appearance of shallowness, the shallow with the appearance of shallowness, the deep with the appearance of depth.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo uttāno hoti gambhīrobhāso? Idha, bhikkhave, ekaccassa puggalassa pāsādikaṃ hoti abhikkantaṃ paṭikkantaṃ ālokitaṃ vilokitaṃ samiñjitaṃ pasāritaṃ saṅghāṭipattacīvaradhāraṇaṃ. So ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti…pe… ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo uttāno hoti gambhīrobhāso. Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, udakarahado uttāno gambhīrobhāso; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi.

And how, monks, is a person shallow but appears profound? Here, monks, a certain person is pleasing in his going forth and returning, his looking ahead and looking around, his bending and stretching, and his wearing of the robes and carrying of the bowl. But he does not truly understand: ‘This is suffering’… ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’ Thus, monks, a person is shallow but appears profound. Just as, monks, a lake is shallow but appears profound, so do I describe this person.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo gambhīro hoti uttānobhāso? Idha, bhikkhave, ekaccassa puggalassa na pāsādikaṃ hoti abhikkantaṃ paṭikkantaṃ ālokitaṃ vilokitaṃ samiñjitaṃ pasāritaṃ saṅghāṭipattacīvaradhāraṇaṃ. So ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti…pe… ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo gambhīro hoti uttānobhāso. Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, udakarahado gambhīro uttānobhāso; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi.

And how, monks, is a person deep but appears shallow? Here, monks, a certain person does not have a pleasing manner in his going forth and returning, his looking ahead and looking around, his bending and stretching, and his wearing of the robes and carrying of the bowl. But he truly understands: ‘This is suffering’… ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’ Thus, monks, a person is deep but appears shallow. Just as, monks, a lake is deep but appears shallow, so do I describe this person.

Catutthaṃ.
