## AN 4.10 The Discourse on Bonds

10. ‘‘Cattārome, bhikkhave, yogā. Katame cattāro? Kāmayogo, bhavayogo, diṭṭhiyogo, avijjāyogo. Katamo ca, bhikkhave, kāmayogo? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco kāmānaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca [atthagamañca (sī. pī.)] assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Tassa kāmānaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ appajānato [nappajānato (syā. kaṃ. ka.)] yo kāmesu kāmarāgo kāmanandī [kāmanandi (sī. syā. kaṃ.)] kāmasneho kāmamucchā kāmapipāsā kāmapariḷāho kāmajjhosānaṃ kāmataṇhā sānuseti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, kāmayogo. Iti kāmayogo.

10. Monks, there are these four yokes. Which four? The yoke of sensual desire, the yoke of becoming, the yoke of views, and the yoke of ignorance. And what, monks, is the yoke of sensual desire? Here, monks, someone does not truly understand the arising, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to sensual desires. Because they do not truly understand the arising, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to sensual desires, sensual lust, sensual delight, sensual affection, sensual infatuation, sensual thirst, sensual fever, sensual clinging, and sensual craving lie latent in them. This, monks, is called the yoke of sensual desire. Thus, the yoke of sensual desire.

‘‘Bhavayogo ca kathaṃ hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco bhavānaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Tassa bhavānaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ appajānato yo bhavesu bhavarāgo bhavanandī bhavasneho bhavamucchā bhavapipāsā bhavapariḷāho bhavajjhosānaṃ bhavataṇhā sānuseti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, bhavayogo. Iti kāmayogo bhavayogo.

And what, monks, is the yoke of becoming? Here, monks, someone does not truly understand the arising, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to becoming. Because they do not truly understand the arising, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to becoming, lust for becoming, delight in becoming, affection for becoming, infatuation with becoming, thirst for becoming, fever for becoming, clinging to becoming, and craving for becoming lie latent in them. This, monks, is called the yoke of becoming. Thus, the yoke of sensual desire, the yoke of becoming.

‘‘Diṭṭhiyogo ca kathaṃ hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco diṭṭhīnaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Tassa diṭṭhīnaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ appajānato yo diṭṭhīsu diṭṭhirāgo diṭṭhinandī diṭṭhisneho diṭṭhimucchā diṭṭhipipāsā diṭṭhipariḷāho diṭṭhijjhosānaṃ [diṭṭhiajjhosānaṃ (sī. pī.)] diṭṭhitaṇhā sānuseti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, diṭṭhiyogo. Iti kāmayogo bhavayogo diṭṭhiyogo.

And what, monks, is the yoke of views? Here, monks, someone does not truly understand the arising, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to views. Because they do not truly understand the arising, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to views, lust for views, delight in views, affection for views, infatuation with views, thirst for views, fever for views, clinging to views, and craving for views lie latent in them. This, monks, is called the yoke of views. Thus, the yoke of sensual desire, the yoke of becoming, the yoke of views.

‘‘Avijjāyogo ca kathaṃ hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco channaṃ phassāyatanānaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Tassa channaṃ phassāyatanānaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ appajānato yā chasu phassāyatanesu avijjā aññāṇaṃ sānuseti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, avijjāyogo. Iti kāmayogo bhavayogo diṭṭhiyogo avijjāyogo, saṃyutto pāpakehi akusalehi dhammehi saṃkilesikehi ponobhavikehi [pono bbhavikehi (syā. ka.)] sadarehi dukkhavipākehi āyatiṃ jātijarāmaraṇikehi. Tasmā ayogakkhemīti vuccati. Ime kho, bhikkhave, cattāro yogā.

And what, monks, is the yoke of ignorance? Here, monks, someone does not truly understand as it actually is the arising, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to the six sense bases. Because they do not truly understand as it actually is the arising, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to the six sense bases, ignorance and unknowing lie latent in them in regard to the six sense bases. This, monks, is called the yoke of ignorance. Thus, the yoke of sensual desire, the yoke of becoming, the yoke of views, and the yoke of ignorance—connected with evil, unwholesome states that lead to defilement, bring renewal of being, are attended by distress, result in suffering, and conduce to future birth, aging, and death—therefore one is called 'not secure from yokes.' These, monks, are the four yokes.

‘‘Cattārome, bhikkhave, visaṃyogā. Katame cattāro? Kāmayogavisaṃyogo, bhavayogavisaṃyogo, diṭṭhiyogavisaṃyogo, avijjāyogavisaṃyogo. Katamo ca, bhikkhave, kāmayogavisaṃyogo? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco kāmānaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Tassa kāmānaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ pajānato yo kāmesu kāmarāgo kāmanandī kāmasneho kāmamucchā kāmapipāsā kāmapariḷāho kāmajjhosānaṃ kāmataṇhā sā nānuseti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, kāmayogavisaṃyogo. Iti kāmayogavisaṃyogo.

Monks, there are these four disjunctions. Which four? Disjunction from the yoke of sensual desire, disjunction from the yoke of becoming, disjunction from the yoke of views, and disjunction from the yoke of ignorance. And what, monks, is disjunction from the yoke of sensual desire? Here, monks, someone understands as it actually is the arising, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to sensual desires. Because they understand as it actually is the arising, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to sensual desires, sensual lust, sensual delight, sensual affection, sensual infatuation, sensual thirst, sensual fever, sensual clinging, and sensual craving—that does not lie latent in them in regard to sensual desires. This, monks, is called disjunction from the yoke of sensual desire. Thus, disjunction from the yoke of sensual desire.

‘‘Bhavayogavisaṃyogo ca kathaṃ hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco bhavānaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Tassa bhavānaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ pajānato yo bhavesu bhavarāgo bhavanandī bhavasneho bhavamucchā bhavapipāsā bhavapariḷāho bhavajjhosānaṃ bhavataṇhā sā nānuseti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, bhavayogavisaṃyogo. Iti kāmayogavisaṃyogo bhavayogavisaṃyogo.

And what, monks, is disjunction from the yoke of becoming? Here, monks, someone understands as it actually is the arising, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to becoming. Because they understand as it actually is the arising, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to becoming, becoming-lust, becoming-delight, becoming-affection, becoming-infatuation, becoming-thirst, becoming-fever, becoming-clinging, and becoming-craving—that does not lie latent in them in regard to becoming. This, monks, is called disjunction from the yoke of becoming. Thus, disjunction from the yoke of sensual desire, disjunction from the yoke of becoming.

‘‘Diṭṭhiyogavisaṃyogo ca kathaṃ hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco diṭṭhīnaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Tassa diṭṭhīnaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ pajānato yo diṭṭhīsu diṭṭhirāgo diṭṭhinandī diṭṭhisneho diṭṭhimucchā diṭṭhipipāsā diṭṭhipariḷāho diṭṭhijjhosānaṃ diṭṭhitaṇhā sā nānuseti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, diṭṭhiyogavisaṃyogo. Iti kāmayogavisaṃyogo bhavayogavisaṃyogo diṭṭhiyogavisaṃyogo.

And what, monks, is disjunction from the yoke of views? Here, monks, someone understands as it actually is the arising, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to views. Because they understand as it actually is the arising, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to views, views-lust, views-delight, views-affection, views-infatuation, views-thirst, views-fever, views-clinging, and views-craving—that does not lie latent in them in regard to views. This, monks, is called disjunction from the yoke of views. Thus, disjunction from the yoke of sensual desire, disjunction from the yoke of becoming, disjunction from the yoke of views.

‘‘Avijjāyogavisaṃyogo ca kathaṃ hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco channaṃ phassāyatanānaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Tassa channaṃ phassāyatanānaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ pajānato yā chasu phassāyatanesu avijjā aññāṇaṃ sā nānuseti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, avijjāyogavisaṃyogo. Iti kāmayogavisaṃyogo bhavayogavisaṃyogo diṭṭhiyogavisaṃyogo avijjāyogavisaṃyogo, visaṃyutto pāpakehi akusalehi dhammehi saṃkilesikehi ponobhavikehi sadarehi dukkhavipākehi āyatiṃ jātijarāmaraṇikehi. Tasmā yogakkhemīti vuccati. Ime kho, bhikkhave, cattāro visaṃyogā’’ti.

‘‘And what, monks, is disjunction from the yoke of ignorance? Here, monks, someone understands as it actually is the arising, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to the six bases for contact. Because they understand as it actually is the arising, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to the six bases for contact, ignorance, unknowing—that does not lie latent in them in regard to the six bases for contact. This, monks, is called disjunction from the yoke of ignorance. Thus, disjunction from the yoke of sensual desire, disjunction from the yoke of becoming, disjunction from the yoke of views, disjunction from the yoke of ignorance. They are disjoined from evil, unwholesome qualities that are defiling, leading to renewed existence, accompanied by anguish, resulting in suffering, and liable to birth, old age, and death in the future. Therefore, one is called ‘secure from bondage.’ These, monks, are the four disjunctions.’’

‘‘Kāmayogena saṃyuttā, bhavayogena cūbhayaṃ;Diṭṭhiyogena saṃyuttā, avijjāya purakkhatā.

"Bound by the yoke of sensual desire and by the yoke of becoming, both; bound by the yoke of views, and led by ignorance."

‘‘Sattā gacchanti saṃsāraṃ, jātimaraṇagāmino;Ye ca kāme pariññāya, bhavayogañca sabbaso.

Beings fare on in the round of rebirths, bound for birth and death; but those who, having fully understood sensual pleasures and the bond of existence in every way,

‘‘Diṭṭhiyogaṃ samūhacca, avijjañca virājayaṃ;Sabbayogavisaṃyuttā, te ve yogātigā munī’’ti. dasamaṃ;

having uprooted the yoke of views and dispelled ignorance, fully disjoined from all yokes—those sages have indeed transcended the yokes.” The tenth.

Bhaṇḍagāmavaggo paṭhamo.

The Chapter on Bhaṇḍagāma, the First.

Tassuddānaṃ –
