## AN 4.20 The Discourse on the Meal Distributor

20. ‘‘Catūhi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhattuddesako yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ niraye. Katamehi catūhi? Chandāgatiṃ gacchati, dosāgatiṃ gacchati, mohāgatiṃ gacchati, bhayāgatiṃ gacchati – imehi kho, bhikkhave, catūhi dhammehi samannāgato bhattuddesako yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ niraye.

20."Monks, a meal distributor endowed with four qualities is consigned to hell just as he was brought there. Which four? He goes by favoritism, goes by aversion, goes by delusion, goes by fear. Monks, a meal distributor endowed with these four qualities is consigned to hell just as he was brought there."

‘‘Catūhi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhattuddesako yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ sagge. Katamehi catūhi? Na chandāgatiṃ gacchati, na dosāgatiṃ gacchati, na mohāgatiṃ gacchati, na bhayāgatiṃ gacchati – imehi kho, bhikkhave, catūhi dhammehi samannāgato bhattuddesako yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ sagge’’ti.

"Monks, a meal distributor endowed with four qualities is consigned to heaven just as he was brought there. Which four? He does not go by favoritism, he does not go by aversion, he does not go by delusion, he does not go by fear. Monks, a meal distributor endowed with these four qualities is consigned to heaven just as he was brought there."

‘‘Ye keci kāmesu asaññatā janā,Adhammikā honti adhammagāravā;Chandā dosā mohā ca bhayā gāmino [chandā ca dosā ca bhayā ca gāmino (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī)],Parisākasaṭo [parisakkasāvo (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] ca panesa vuccati.

"Those who are unrestrained in sensual pleasures, unrighteous, and without respect for righteousness, going by desire, aversion, delusion, and fear, such a person is called the scum of the assembly.

‘‘Evañhi vuttaṃ samaṇena jānatā,Tasmā hi te sappurisā pasaṃsiyā;Dhamme ṭhitā ye na karonti pāpakaṃ,Na chandā na dosā na mohā na bhayā ca gāmino [na chandadosā na bhayā ca gāmino (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)];‘‘Parisāya maṇḍo ca panesa vuccati,Evañhi vuttaṃ samaṇena jānatā’’ti. dasamaṃ;

Thus it was said by the Sage, the Knower,
Therefore, those good people are indeed praiseworthy;
Established in the Dhamma, they do not do evil,
Not going by desire, nor by aversion, nor by delusion, nor by fear.
He is called the ornament of the assembly,
Thus it was said by the Sage, the Knower." Tenth.

The Wanderer Chapter, the Second.

Tassuddānaṃ –

Its summary:

Caraṃ sīlaṃ padhānāni, saṃvaraṃ paññatti pañcamaṃ;Sokhummaṃ tayo agatī, bhattuddesena te dasāti.

Walking, virtue, striving,
Restraint, regulation as the fifth,
Subtlety, the three wrong courses,
With the meal distributor, these are ten.
