4. ‘‘Catūsu, bhikkhave, micchā paṭipajjamāno bālo abyatto asappuriso khataṃ upahataṃ attānaṃ pariharati sāvajjo ca hoti sānuvajjo ca viññūnaṃ, bahuñca apuññaṃ pasavati. Katamesu catūsu? Mātari, bhikkhave, micchā paṭipajjamāno bālo abyatto asappuriso khataṃ upahataṃ attānaṃ pariharati, sāvajjo ca hoti sānuvajjo ca viññūnaṃ, bahuñca apuññaṃ pasavati. Pitari, bhikkhave, micchā paṭipajjamāno…pe… tathāgate, bhikkhave, micchā paṭipajjamāno…pe… tathāgatasāvake, bhikkhave, micchā paṭipajjamāno bālo abyatto asappuriso khataṃ upahataṃ attānaṃ pariharati, sāvajjo ca hoti sānuvajjo ca viññūnaṃ, bahuñca apuññaṃ pasavati. Imesu kho, bhikkhave, catūsu micchā paṭipajjamāno bālo abyatto asappuriso khataṃ upahataṃ attānaṃ pariharati, sāvajjo ca hoti sānuvajjo ca viññūnaṃ, bahuñca apuññaṃ pasavati.

4. "Monks, a foolish, undeveloped, ignoble person who behaves wrongly in four ways carries himself about as one ruined and devastated; he is blameworthy and censurable by the wise, and he generates much demerit. What are these four?
Here, monks, when a foolish, undeveloped, ignoble person behaves wrongly toward his mother, he carries himself about as one ruined and devastated; he is blameworthy and censurable by the wise, and he generates much demerit.
When he behaves wrongly toward his father...
...toward the Tathāgata...
...toward a disciple of the Tathāgata, monks, a foolish, undeveloped, ignoble person carries himself about as one ruined and devastated; he is blameworthy and censurable by the wise, and he generates much demerit.
It is in these four ways, monks, that a foolish, undeveloped, ignoble person who behaves wrongly carries himself about as one ruined and devastated; he is blameworthy and censurable by the wise, and he generates much demerit."

‘‘Catūsu, bhikkhave, sammā paṭipajjamāno paṇḍito viyatto sappuriso akkhataṃ anupahataṃ attānaṃ pariharati, anavajjo ca hoti ananuvajjo ca viññūnaṃ, bahuñca puññaṃ pasavati. Katamesu catūsu? Mātari, bhikkhave, sammā paṭipajjamāno paṇḍito viyatto sappuriso akkhataṃ anupahataṃ attānaṃ pariharati, anavajjo ca hoti ananuvajjo ca viññūnaṃ, bahuñca puññaṃ pasavati. Pitari, bhikkhave, sammā paṭipajjamāno…pe… tathāgate, bhikkhave, sammā paṭipajjamāno…pe… tathāgatasāvake, bhikkhave, sammā paṭipajjamāno paṇḍito viyatto sappuriso akkhataṃ anupahataṃ attānaṃ pariharati, anavajjo ca hoti ananuvajjo ca viññūnaṃ, bahuñca puññaṃ pasavati.

"Monks, a wise, discerning, and virtuous person who behaves rightly in four ways carries himself about as one unruined and undevastated; he is blameless and irreproachable by the wise, and he generates much merit. What are these four?
Here, monks, when a wise, discerning, and virtuous person behaves rightly toward his mother, he carries himself about as one unruined and undevastated; he is blameless and irreproachable by the wise, and he generates much merit.

‘‘Mātari pitari cāpi, yo micchā paṭipajjati;Tathāgate vā sambuddhe, atha vā tassa sāvake;Bahuñca so pasavati, apuññaṃ tādiso naro.

"Whoever behaves improperly towards mother and father, or towards the Tathagata, the Fully Enlightened One, or his disciples, such a person generates much demerit."

‘‘Tāya naṃ adhammacariyāya [tāya adhammacariyāya (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)], mātāpitūsu paṇḍitā;Idheva naṃ garahanti, peccāpāyañca gacchati.

Because of that unrighteous conduct towards his mother and father, the wise rebuke him here in this life; after death, he goes to a state of suffering.

‘‘Mātari pitari cāpi, yo sammā paṭipajjati;Tathāgate vā sambuddhe, atha vā tassa sāvake;Bahuñca so pasavati, puññaṃ etādiso [puññampi tādiso (sī. syā. kaṃ.)] naro.

"One who acts rightly towards mother and father, or towards the Tathāgata, the Fully Enlightened One, or his disciples, such a person generates much merit."

‘‘Tāya naṃ dhammacariyāya, mātāpitūsu paṇḍitā;Idheva [idha ceva (sī.)] naṃ pasaṃsanti, pecca sagge pamodatī’’ti [sagge ca modatīti (sī.)]. catutthaṃ;

Because of that righteous conduct towards his mother and father, the wise praise him here in this life; after death, he rejoices in heaven. This is the fourth.
