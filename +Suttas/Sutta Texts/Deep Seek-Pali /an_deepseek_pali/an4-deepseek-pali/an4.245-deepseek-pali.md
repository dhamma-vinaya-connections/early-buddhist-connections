245. ‘‘Sikkhānisaṃsamidaṃ, bhikkhave, brahmacariyaṃ vussati paññuttaraṃ vimuttisāraṃ satādhipateyyaṃ. Kathañca, bhikkhave, sikkhānisaṃsaṃ hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, mayā sāvakānaṃ ābhisamācārikā sikkhā paññattā appasannānaṃ pasādāya pasannānaṃ bhiyyobhāvāya. Yathā yathā, bhikkhave, mayā sāvakānaṃ ābhisamācārikā sikkhā paññattā appasannānaṃ pasādāya pasannānaṃ bhiyyobhāvāya tathā tathā so tassā sikkhāya akhaṇḍakārī hoti acchiddakārī asabalakārī akammāsakārī, samādāya sikkhati sikkhāpadesu.

245.“Monks, this holy life is lived with training as its benefit, with wisdom as its culmination, with liberation as its essence, and with mindfulness as its dominion. And how, monks, is it with training as its benefit? Here, monks, I have laid down the training in conduct and good manners for disciples for the sake of inspiring confidence in those without it and for increasing the confidence of those who have it.

Yathā yathā, bhikkhave, mayā sāvakānaṃ ādibrahmacariyikā sikkhā paññattā sabbaso sammā dukkhakkhayāya tathā tathā so tassā sikkhāya akhaṇḍakārī hoti acchiddakārī asabalakārī akammāsakārī, samādāya sikkhati sikkhāpadesu. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, sikkhānisaṃsaṃ hoti.

“Furthermore, monks, I have laid down for my disciples the fundamental training in the holy life entirely for the complete ending of suffering.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, satādhipateyyaṃ hoti? ‘Iti aparipūraṃ vā ābhisamācārikaṃ sikkhaṃ paripūressāmi, paripūraṃ vā ābhisamācārikaṃ sikkhaṃ tattha tattha paññāya anuggahessāmī’ti – ajjhattaṃyeva sati sūpaṭṭhitā hoti. ‘Iti aparipūraṃ vā ādibrahmacariyikaṃ sikkhaṃ paripūressāmi, paripūraṃ vā ādibrahmacariyikaṃ sikkhaṃ tattha tattha paññāya anuggahessāmī’ti – ajjhattaṃyeva sati sūpaṭṭhitā hoti. ‘Iti asamavekkhitaṃ vā dhammaṃ paññāya samavekkhissāmi, samavekkhitaṃ vā dhammaṃ tattha tattha paññāya anuggahessāmī’ti – ajjhattaṃyeva sati sūpaṭṭhitā hoti. ‘Iti aphusitaṃ vā dhammaṃ vimuttiyā phusissāmi, phusitaṃ vā dhammaṃ tattha tattha paññāya anuggahessāmī’ti – ajjhattaṃyeva sati sūpaṭṭhitā hoti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, satādhipateyyaṃ hoti. ‘Sikkhānisaṃsamidaṃ, bhikkhave, brahmacariyaṃ vussati paññuttaraṃ vimuttisāraṃ satādhipateyya’nti, iti yaṃ taṃ vuttaṃ idametaṃ paṭicca vutta’’nti. Tatiyaṃ.

“And how, monks, is it with mindfulness as its dominion? ‘Thus I will fulfill the training in conduct and good manners where it is incomplete, or where it is complete, I will support it with insight-wisdom in every respect’—mindfulness is well established internally. ‘Thus I will fulfill the fundamental training in the holy life where it is incomplete, or where it is complete, I will support it with insight-wisdom in every respect’—mindfulness is well established internally. ‘Thus I will examine with insight-wisdom the Dhamma where it is unexamined, or where it is examined, I will support it with insight-wisdom in every respect’—mindfulness is well established internally. ‘Thus I will experience with liberation the Dhamma where it is unexperienced, or where it is experienced, I will support it with path-wisdom in every respect’—mindfulness is well established internally. Thus, monks, it is with mindfulness as its dominion. ‘This holy life, monks, is lived with training as its benefit, with wisdom as its culmination, with liberation as its essence, with mindfulness as its dominion’—this was said with reference to this.”
