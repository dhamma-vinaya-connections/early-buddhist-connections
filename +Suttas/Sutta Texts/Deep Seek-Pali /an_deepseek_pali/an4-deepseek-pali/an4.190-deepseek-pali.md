# AN 4.190 Uposathasuttaṃ

## AN 4.190 The Uposatha Discourse

190. Ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati pubbārāme migāramātupāsāde. Tena kho pana samayena bhagavā tadahuposathe bhikkhusaṅghaparivuto nisinno hoti. Atha kho bhagavā tuṇhībhūtaṃ tuṇhībhūtaṃ bhikkhusaṅghaṃ anuviloketvā bhikkhū āmantesi –

190.On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in the Eastern Park, in Migara's Mother's Mansion. At that time, on the Uposatha day, the Blessed One was seated surrounded by the Sangha of monks. Then, having surveyed the silent Sangha of monks, the Blessed One addressed the monks:

‘‘Apalāpāyaṃ, bhikkhave, parisā nippalāpāyaṃ, bhikkhave, parisā suddhā sāre patiṭṭhitā. Tathārūpo ayaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhusaṅgho, tathārūpāyaṃ, bhikkhave, parisā. Yathārūpā parisā dullabhā dassanāyapi lokasmiṃ, tathārūpo ayaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhusaṅgho, tathārūpāyaṃ, bhikkhave, parisā. Yathārūpā parisā āhuneyyā pāhuneyyā dakkhiṇeyyā añjalikaraṇīyā anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassa, tathārūpo ayaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhusaṅgho, tathārūpāyaṃ, bhikkhave, parisā. Yathārūpāya parisāya appaṃ dinnaṃ bahu hoti bahu dinnaṃ bahutaraṃ, tathārūpo ayaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhusaṅgho, tathārūpāyaṃ, bhikkhave, parisā. Yathārūpaṃ parisaṃ alaṃ yojanagaṇanānipi dassanāya gantuṃ api puṭosenāpi, tathārūpo ayaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhusaṅgho, (tathārūpāyaṃ, bhikkhave, parisā) [( ) sī. syā. kaṃ. pī. potthakesu natthi].

"This assembly, monks, is free from idle talk; this assembly, monks, is free from idle talk, pure, and established in what is essential. Such is this Saṅgha of monks, such is this assembly. Such an assembly is rare even to see in the world; such is this Saṅgha of monks, such is this assembly. Such an assembly is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world; such is this Saṅgha of monks, such is this assembly. Such an assembly as to which a little given becomes much, and much given becomes even more; such is this Saṅgha of monks, such is this assembly. Such an assembly that it is worth traveling even many yojanas to see, even with a hamper prepared for the journey; such is this Saṅgha of monks, such is this assembly."

‘‘Santi, bhikkhave, bhikkhū imasmiṃ bhikkhusaṅghe devappattā viharanti; santi, bhikkhave, bhikkhū imasmiṃ bhikkhusaṅghe brahmappattā viharanti; santi, bhikkhave, bhikkhū imasmiṃ bhikkhusaṅghe āneñjappattā viharanti; santi, bhikkhave, bhikkhū imasmiṃ bhikkhusaṅghe ariyappattā viharanti.

"There are, monks, bhikkhus in this Saṅgha who live having attained the divine; there are, monks, bhikkhus in this Saṅgha who live having attained the Brahma-state; there are, monks, bhikkhus in this Saṅgha who live having attained the imperturbable; there are, monks, bhikkhus in this Saṅgha who live having attained the noble."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu devappatto hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vivicceva kāmehi…pe… paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati; vitakkavicārānaṃ vūpasamā…pe… dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ…pe… tatiyaṃ jhānaṃ…pe… catutthaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu devappatto hoti.

"And how, monks, has a bhikkhu attained the divine? Here, monks, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhana, which is accompanied by applied thought and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. With the subsiding of applied thought and sustained thought, he enters and dwells in the second jhana, which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without applied thought and sustained thought, and is filled with rapture and pleasure born of concentration. With the fading away of rapture, he dwells in equanimity, mindful and clearly comprehending, and experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare: ‘He dwells in equanimity, mindful, and blissful.’ With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the prior disappearance of joy and grief, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhana, which is neither painful nor pleasant and is purified by equanimity and mindfulness. Thus, monks, a bhikkhu has attained the divine."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu brahmappatto hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu mettāsahagatena cetasā ekaṃ disaṃ pharitvā viharati, tathā dutiyaṃ tathā tatiyaṃ tathā catutthaṃ. Iti uddhamadho tiriyaṃ sabbadhi sabbattatāya sabbāvantaṃ lokaṃ mettāsahagatena cetasā vipulena mahaggatena appamāṇena averena abyāpajjena pharitvā viharati. Karuṇā… muditā… upekkhāsahagatena cetasā ekaṃ disaṃ pharitvā viharati, tathā dutiyaṃ tathā tatiyaṃ tathā catutthaṃ. Iti uddhamadho tiriyaṃ sabbadhi sabbattatāya sabbāvantaṃ lokaṃ upekkhāsahagatena cetasā vipulena mahaggatena appamāṇena averena abyāpajjena pharitvā viharati. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu brahmappatto hoti.

"And how, monks, has a bhikkhu attained the Brahma-state? Here, monks, a bhikkhu dwells pervading one direction with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth. Thus above, below, across, everywhere, in every respect, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will. He dwells pervading one direction with a mind imbued with compassion, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth. Thus above, below, across, everywhere, in every respect, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with compassion, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will. He dwells pervading one direction with a mind imbued with sympathetic joy, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth. Thus above, below, across, everywhere, in every respect, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with sympathetic joy, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will. He dwells pervading one direction with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth. Thus above, below, across, everywhere, in every respect, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will. Thus, monks, a bhikkhu has attained the Brahma-state."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu āneñjappatto hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sabbaso rūpasaññānaṃ samatikkamā paṭighasaññānaṃ atthaṅgamā nānattasaññānaṃ amanasikārā ‘ananto ākāso’ti ākāsānañcāyatanaṃ upasampajja viharati. Sabbaso ākāsānañcāyatanaṃ samatikkamma ‘anantaṃ viññāṇa’nti viññāṇañcāyatanaṃ upasampajja viharati. Sabbaso viññāṇañcāyatanaṃ samatikkamma ‘natthi kiñcī’ti ākiñcaññāyatanaṃ upasampajja viharati. Sabbaso ākiñcaññāyatanaṃ samatikkamma nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṃ upasampajja viharati. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu āneñjappatto hoti.

"And how, monks, has a bhikkhu attained the imperturbable? Here, monks, with the complete transcending of perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, not attending to perceptions of diversity, thinking ‘space is infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of infinite space. With the complete transcending of the base of infinite space, thinking ‘consciousness is infinite,’ he enters and dwells in the base of infinite consciousness. With the complete transcending of the base of infinite consciousness, thinking ‘there is nothing,’ he enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. With the complete transcending of the base of nothingness, he enters and dwells in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Thus, monks, a bhikkhu has attained the imperturbable."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ariyappatto hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti…pe… ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ariyappatto hotī’’ti. Dasamaṃ.

"And how, monks, has a bhikkhu attained the noble? Here, monks, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: ‘This is suffering’; he understands as it really is: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; he understands as it really is: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; he understands as it really is: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’ Thus, monks, a bhikkhu has attained the noble."
