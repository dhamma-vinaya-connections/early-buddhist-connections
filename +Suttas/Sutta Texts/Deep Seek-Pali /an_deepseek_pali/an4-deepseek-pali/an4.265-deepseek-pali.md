## AN 4.265 The Discourse on Taking What Is Not Given

265. ‘‘Catūhi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ niraye. Katamehi catūhi? Attanā ca adinnādāyī hoti, parañca adinnādāne samādapeti, adinnādāne ca samanuñño hoti, adinnādānassa ca vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati – imehi kho…pe….

265.Monks, one endowed with four qualities is consigned to hell as if brought there. What four? He himself takes what is not given, he encourages others in taking what is not given, he approves of taking what is not given, and he speaks in praise of taking what is not given. Endowed with these four qualities, monks, one is consigned to hell as if brought there.

‘‘Attanā ca adinnādānā paṭivirato hoti, parañca adinnādānā veramaṇiyā samādapeti, adinnādānā veramaṇiyā ca samanuñño hoti, adinnādānā veramaṇiyā ca vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati – imehi kho, bhikkhave…pe…. Dutiyaṃ.

He himself abstains from taking what is not given, he encourages others to abstain from taking what is not given, he approves of abstaining from taking what is not given, and he speaks in praise of abstaining from taking what is not given. Endowed with these four qualities, monks, one is consigned to heaven as if brought there. Second.
