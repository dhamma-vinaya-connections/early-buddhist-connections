# AN 4.62 Ānaṇyasuttaṃ

## AN 4.62 The Discourse on Debtlessness

62. Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho anāthapiṇḍikaṃ gahapatiṃ bhagavā etadavoca –

62.Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. As he was sitting to one side, the Blessed One said this to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika:

‘‘Cattārimāni, gahapati, sukhāni adhigamanīyāni gihinā kāmabhoginā kālena kālaṃ samayena samayaṃ upādāya. Katamāni cattāri? Atthisukhaṃ, bhogasukhaṃ, ānaṇyasukhaṃ [aṇaṇasukhaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)], anavajjasukhaṃ.

“Householder, there are these four kinds of happiness that can be attained by a householder who enjoys sensual pleasures, from time to time, on occasion. What four? The happiness of having, the happiness of enjoying wealth, the happiness of debtlessness, and the happiness of blamelessness.

‘‘Katamañca, gahapati, atthisukhaṃ? Idha, gahapati, kulaputtassa bhogā honti uṭṭhānavīriyādhigatā bāhābalaparicitā sedāvakkhittā dhammikā dhammaladdhā. So ‘bhogā me atthi uṭṭhānavīriyādhigatā bāhābalaparicitā sedāvakkhittā dhammikā dhammaladdhā’ti adhigacchati sukhaṃ, adhigacchati somanassaṃ. Idaṃ vuccati, gahapati, atthisukhaṃ.

And what, householder, is the happiness of having? Here, householder, a clansman has wealth acquired through energetic striving, accumulated by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous, and rightfully gained. He experiences happiness and joy, thinking, ‘I have wealth acquired through energetic striving, accumulated by the strength of my arms, earned by the sweat of my brow, righteous, and rightfully gained.’ This is called the happiness of having.

‘‘Katamañca, gahapati, bhogasukhaṃ? Idha, gahapati, kulaputto uṭṭhānavīriyādhigatehi bhogehi bāhābalaparicitehi sedāvakkhittehi dhammikehi dhammaladdhehi paribhuñjati puññāni ca karoti. So ‘uṭṭhānavīriyādhigatehi bhogehi bāhābalaparicitehi sedāvakkhittehi dhammikehi dhammaladdhehi paribhuñjāmi puññāni ca karomī’ti adhigacchati sukhaṃ, adhigacchati somanassaṃ. Idaṃ vuccati, gahapati, bhogasukhaṃ.

And what, householder, is the happiness of enjoying wealth? Here, householder, a clansman enjoys wealth acquired through energetic striving, accumulated by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous, and rightfully gained, and performs meritorious deeds. He experiences happiness and joy, thinking, ‘I enjoy wealth acquired through energetic striving, accumulated by the strength of my arms, earned by the sweat of my brow, righteous, and rightfully gained, and perform meritorious deeds.’ This is called the happiness of enjoying wealth.

‘‘Katamañca, gahapati, ānaṇyasukhaṃ? Idha, gahapati, kulaputto na kassaci kiñci dhāreti appaṃ vā bahuṃ vā. So ‘na kassaci kiñci dhāremi [kiñci vā deti (ka.)] appaṃ vā bahuṃ vā’ti adhigacchati sukhaṃ, adhigacchati somanassaṃ. Idaṃ vuccati, gahapati, ānaṇyasukhaṃ.

And what, householder, is the happiness of debtlessness? Here, householder, a clansman owes nothing to anyone, be it little or much. He experiences happiness and joy, thinking, ‘I owe nothing to anyone, be it little or much.’ This is called the happiness of debtlessness.

‘‘Katamañca, gahapati, anavajjasukhaṃ? Idha, gahapati, ariyasāvako anavajjena kāyakammena samannāgato hoti, anavajjena vacīkammena samannāgato hoti, anavajjena manokammena samannāgato hoti. So ‘anavajjenamhi kāyakammena samannāgato, anavajjena vacīkammena samannāgato, anavajjena manokammena samannāgato’ti adhigacchati sukhaṃ, adhigacchati somanassaṃ. Idaṃ vuccati, gahapati, anavajjasukhaṃ. Imāni kho, gahapati, cattāri sukhāni adhigamanīyāni gihinā kāmabhoginā kālena kālaṃ samayena samayaṃ upādāyā’’ti.

And what, householder, is the happiness of blamelessness? Here, householder, a noble disciple is endowed with blameless bodily action, blameless verbal action, and blameless mental action. He experiences happiness and joy, thinking: ‘I am endowed with blameless bodily action, blameless verbal action, and blameless mental action.’ This is called the happiness of blamelessness. These, householder, are the four kinds of happiness to be attained by a householder who enjoys sensual pleasures, from time to time, on occasion.”

‘‘Ānaṇyasukhaṃ ñatvāna, atho atthisukhaṃ paraṃ;Bhuñjaṃ bhogasukhaṃ macco, tato paññā vipassati.

Having known the happiness of debtlessness, and then the happiness of having; enjoying the happiness of wealth, the mortal then sees clearly with wisdom.

‘‘Vipassamāno jānāti, ubho bhoge sumedhaso;Anavajjasukhassetaṃ, kalaṃ nāgghati soḷasi’’nti. dutiyaṃ;

Seeing clearly, the wise one knows both categories; this does not equal a sixteenth part of the happiness of blamelessness.
