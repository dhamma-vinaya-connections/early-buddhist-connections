# AN 4.24 Kāḷakārāmasuttaṃ

## AN 4.24 Kāḷakārāma Sutta

24. Ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sākete viharati kāḷakārāme [koḷikārāme (ka.)]. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘bhikkhavo’’ti. ‘‘Bhadante’’ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca –

24.At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāketa in the Kāḷakārāma. There the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks." "Venerable sir," those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

‘‘Yaṃ, bhikkhave, sadevakassa lokassa samārakassa sabrahmakassa sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiyā pajāya sadevamanussāya diṭṭhaṃ sutaṃ mutaṃ viññātaṃ pattaṃ pariyesitaṃ anuvicaritaṃ manasā, tamahaṃ jānāmi.

"Monks, whatever in the world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, its generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its population with its gods and humans, is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, and explored by the mind—that I know."

‘‘Yaṃ, bhikkhave, sadevakassa lokassa samārakassa sabrahmakassa sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiyā pajāya sadevamanussāya diṭṭhaṃ sutaṃ mutaṃ viññātaṃ pattaṃ pariyesitaṃ anuvicaritaṃ manasā, tamahaṃ abbhaññāsiṃ. Taṃ tathāgatassa viditaṃ, taṃ tathāgato na upaṭṭhāsi.

"Monks, whatever in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, its generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its population with its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, and explored by the mind—that I have directly known. That is known by the Tathāgata, but the Tathāgata does not adhere to it."

‘‘Yaṃ, bhikkhave, sadevakassa lokassa samārakassa sabrahmakassa sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiyā pajāya sadevamanussāya diṭṭhaṃ sutaṃ mutaṃ viññātaṃ pattaṃ pariyesitaṃ anuvicaritaṃ manasā, tamahaṃ na jānāmīti vadeyyaṃ, taṃ mamassa musā.

"Monks, if I were to say, 'I do not know that which in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, its generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its population with its gods and humans, has been seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, and explored by the mind,' that would be a falsehood for me."

‘‘Yaṃ, bhikkhave…pe… tamahaṃ jānāmi ca na ca jānāmīti vadeyyaṃ, taṃpassa [taṃ pissa (syā. kaṃ.), taṃ mamassa (ka.)] tādisameva.

"Monks, if I were to say, 'I both know and do not know whatever in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, its generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its population with its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, and explored by the mind—,' that too would be a falsehood."

‘‘Yaṃ, bhikkhave…pe… tamahaṃ neva jānāmi na na jānāmīti vadeyyaṃ, taṃ mamassa kali.

"Monks, if I were to say about whatever in the world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, its generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its population with its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, and explored by the mind, 'I neither know it nor do not know it,' that would be a fault for me."

‘‘Iti kho, bhikkhave, tathāgato daṭṭhā daṭṭhabbaṃ, diṭṭhaṃ na maññati, adiṭṭhaṃ na maññati, daṭṭhabbaṃ na maññati, daṭṭhāraṃ na maññati; sutvā sotabbaṃ, sutaṃ na maññati, asutaṃ na maññati, sotabbaṃ na maññati, sotāraṃ na maññati; mutvā motabbaṃ, mutaṃ na maññati, amutaṃ na maññati, motabbaṃ na maññati, motāraṃ na maññati; viññatvā viññātabbaṃ, viññātaṃ na maññati, aviññātaṃ na maññati, viññātabbaṃ na maññati, viññātāraṃ na maññati. Iti kho, bhikkhave, tathāgato diṭṭhasutamutaviññātabbesu dhammesu tādīyeva tādī [tādisova tādī (syā. kaṃ.), tādise yeva tādī (pī.), tādīyeva tādīyevekā (ka.)]. Tamhā ca pana tādimhā [tāditamhā (sī. pī.)] añño tādī uttaritaro vā paṇītataro vā natthīti vadāmī’’ti.

"Thus, monks, the Tathāgata, having seen what is to be seen, does not imagine the seen, does not imagine the unseen, does not imagine what is to be seen, does not imagine one who sees. Having heard what is to be heard, he does not imagine the heard, does not imagine the unheard, does not imagine what is to be heard, does not imagine one who hears. Having sensed what is to be sensed, he does not imagine the sensed, does not imagine the unsensed, does not imagine what is to be sensed, does not imagine one who senses. Having cognized what is to be cognized, he does not imagine the cognized, does not imagine the uncognized, does not imagine what is to be cognized, does not imagine one who cognizes. Thus, monks, the Tathāgata is truly steadfast regarding things seen, heard, sensed, and cognized. And I say there is no other who is the same as this, nor superior or finer."

‘‘Yaṃ kiñci diṭṭhaṃva sutaṃ mutaṃ vā,Ajjhositaṃ saccamutaṃ paresaṃ;Na tesu tādī sayasaṃvutesu,Saccaṃ musā vāpi paraṃ daheyya.

"Whatever is seen, heard, or sensed,
Or clung to as true by others,
The steadfast one does not assert among those who are self-controlled (in their views),
nor would he assert any as true or false."

‘‘Etañca sallaṃ paṭikacca [paṭigacca (sī. pī.)] disvā,Ajjhositā yattha pajā visattā;Jānāmi passāmi tatheva etaṃ,Ajjhositaṃ natthi tathāgatāna’’nti. catutthaṃ;

"Having seen this dart beforehand,
Where beings are addicted and attached,
I know and see this as it is:
There is no such clinging for Tathāgatas." Fourth.
