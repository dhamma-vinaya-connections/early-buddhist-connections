## AN 4.186 The Ummagga Discourse

186. Atha kho aññataro bhikkhu yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho so bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kena nu kho, bhante, loko nīyati, kena loko parikassati, kassa ca uppannassa vasaṃ gacchatī’’ti?

186.Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "By what, venerable sir, is the world led? By what is the world drawn along? And under whose power does it fall when it has arisen?"

‘‘Sādhu sādhu, bhikkhu! Bhaddako kho te, bhikkhu, ummaggo [ummaṅgo (syā. ka.)], bhaddakaṃ paṭibhānaṃ, kalyāṇī [kalyāṇā (ka.)] paripucchā. Evañhi tvaṃ, bhikkhu, pucchasi – ‘kena nu kho, bhante, loko nīyati, kena loko parikassati, kassa ca uppannassa vasaṃ gacchatī’’’ti? ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’. ‘‘Cittena kho, bhikkhu, loko nīyati, cittena parikassati, cittassa uppannassa vasaṃ gacchatī’’ti.

"Good, good, monk! Excellent is your approach, monk, excellent is your understanding, beautiful is your questioning. For you ask thus: ‘By what, venerable sir, is the world led? By what is the world drawn along? Under whose control does the arisen world fall?’" "Yes, venerable sir." "By the mind, monk, the world is led, by the mind it is drawn along, under the control of the arisen mind the world falls."

‘‘Sādhu, bhante’’ti kho so bhikkhu bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinanditvā anumoditvā bhagavantaṃ uttari pañhaṃ apucchi – ‘‘‘bahussuto dhammadharo, bahussuto dhammadharo’ti, bhante, vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, bahussuto dhammadharo hotī’’ti?

"Good, venerable sir," said that monk. Having rejoiced and expressed appreciation for the Blessed One’s words, he asked the Blessed One a further question: "‘Learned, a bearer of the Dhamma, learned, a bearer of the Dhamma,’ venerable sir, it is said. To what extent, venerable sir, is one learned and a bearer of the Dhamma?"

‘‘Sādhu sādhu, bhikkhu! Bhaddako kho te, bhikkhu ummaggo, bhaddakaṃ paṭibhānaṃ, kalyāṇī paripucchā. Evañhi tvaṃ, bhikkhu, pucchasi – ‘bahussuto dhammadharo, bahussuto dhammadharoti, bhante, vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, bahussuto dhammadharo hotī’’’ti? ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’. ‘‘Bahū kho, bhikkhu, mayā dhammā desitā [bahu kho bhikkhu mayā dhammo desito (ka.)] – suttaṃ, geyyaṃ, veyyākaraṇaṃ, gāthā, udānaṃ, itivuttakaṃ, jātakaṃ, abbhutadhammaṃ, vedallaṃ. Catuppadāya cepi, bhikkhu, gāthāya atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya dhammānudhammappaṭipanno hoti bahussuto dhammadharoti alaṃ vacanāyā’’ti.

"Good, good, monk! Excellent indeed is your approach, monk, excellent is your understanding, beautiful is your questioning. For you ask thus: ‘"Learned, a bearer of the Dhamma, learned, a bearer of the Dhamma," venerable sir, it is said. To what extent, venerable sir, is one learned and a bearer of the Dhamma?’" "Yes, venerable sir." "Many teachings, monk, have been taught by me—suttas, geyyas, veyyākaraṇas, gāthās, udānas, itivuttakas, jātakas, abbhutadhammas, and vedallas. If, monk, one understands the meaning and the Dhamma of even a four-line verse and practices in accordance with the Dhamma, it is enough to call him ‘learned, a bearer of the Dhamma.’"

‘‘Sādhu, bhante’’ti kho so bhikkhu bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinanditvā anumoditvā bhagavantaṃ uttari pañhaṃ apucchi – ‘‘‘sutavā nibbedhikapañño, sutavā nibbedhikapañño’ti, bhante, vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, sutavā nibbedhikapañño hotī’’ti?

"Good, venerable sir," that monk, having rejoiced and delighted in the Blessed One’s words, asked him a further question: "‘One who has heard much, with penetrating wisdom, one who has heard much, with penetrating wisdom’—so, venerable sir, it is said. To what extent, venerable sir, does one who has heard much have penetrating wisdom?"

‘‘Sādhu sādhu, bhikkhu! Bhaddako kho te, bhikkhu, ummaggo, bhaddakaṃ paṭibhānaṃ, kalyāṇī paripucchā. Evañhi tvaṃ, bhikkhu, pucchasi – ‘sutavā nibbedhikapañño, sutavā nibbedhikapaññoti, bhante, vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, sutavā nibbedhikapañño hotī’’’ti? ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’. ‘‘Idha, bhikkhu, bhikkhuno ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti sutaṃ hoti, paññāya cassa atthaṃ ativijjha passati; ‘ayaṃ dukkhasamudayo’ti sutaṃ hoti, paññāya cassa atthaṃ ativijjha passati; ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodho’ti sutaṃ hoti, paññāya cassa atthaṃ ativijjha passati; ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti sutaṃ hoti, paññāya cassa atthaṃ ativijjha passati. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhu, sutavā nibbedhikapañño hotī’’ti.

"Good, good, monk! Excellent is your approach, monk, excellent is your understanding, beautiful is your questioning. For you ask thus: ‘"One who has heard much, with penetrating wisdom," "one who has heard much, with penetrating wisdom"—so, venerable sir, it is said. To what extent, venerable sir, is one a person who has heard much and has penetrating wisdom?’" "Yes, venerable sir." "Here, monk, a monk has heard, ‘This is suffering,’ and with wisdom he pierces through and sees its meaning; he has heard, ‘This is the origin of suffering,’ and with wisdom he pierces through and sees its meaning; he has heard, ‘This is the cessation of suffering,’ and with wisdom he pierces through and sees its meaning; he has heard, ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering,’ and with wisdom he pierces through and sees its meaning. Thus, monk, one is a person who has heard much and has penetrating wisdom."

‘‘Sādhu, bhante’’ti kho so bhikkhu bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinanditvā anumoditvā bhagavantaṃ uttari pañhaṃ apucchi – ‘‘‘paṇḍito mahāpañño, paṇḍito mahāpañño’ti, bhante, vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, paṇḍito mahāpañño hotī’’ti?

"Good, venerable sir," that monk, having rejoiced and delighted in the Blessed One’s words, asked the Blessed One a further question: "‘A wise one, of great wisdom, a wise one, of great wisdom’—so, venerable sir, it is said. To what extent, venerable sir, does one become a wise one of great wisdom?"

‘‘Sādhu sādhu bhikkhu! Bhaddako kho te, bhikkhu, ummaggo, bhaddakaṃ paṭibhānaṃ, kalyāṇī paripucchā. Evañhi tvaṃ bhikkhu pucchasi – ‘paṇḍito mahāpañño, paṇḍito mahāpaññoti, bhante, vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, paṇḍito mahāpañño hotī’’’ti? ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’. ‘‘Idha, bhikkhu, paṇḍito mahāpañño nevattabyābādhāya ceteti na parabyābādhāya ceteti na ubhayabyābādhāya ceteti attahitaparahitaubhayahitasabbalokahitameva cintayamāno cinteti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhu, paṇḍito mahāpañño hotī’’ti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

"Good, good, monk! Good indeed is your approach, monk, good is your understanding, beautiful is your questioning. For you ask thus: ‘A wise one, of great wisdom, a wise one, of great wisdom—so, venerable sir, it is said. To what extent, venerable sir, is one a wise one of great wisdom?’" "Yes, venerable sir." "Here, monk, a wise one of great wisdom does not intend for his own affliction, nor for the affliction of others, nor for the affliction of both; but thinking, he thinks only of what is beneficial for himself, for others, for both, and for the welfare of the whole world. Thus, monk, one is a wise one of great wisdom." The sixth.
