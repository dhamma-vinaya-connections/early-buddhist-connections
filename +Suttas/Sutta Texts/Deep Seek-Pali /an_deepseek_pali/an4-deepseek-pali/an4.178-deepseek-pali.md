## AN 4.178 The Jambālī Sutta

178. ‘‘Cattārome, bhikkhave, puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ. Katame cattāro? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu aññataraṃ santaṃ cetovimuttiṃ upasampajja viharati. So sakkāyanirodhaṃ manasi karoti. Tassa sakkāyanirodhaṃ manasi karoto sakkāyanirodhe cittaṃ na pakkhandati nappasīdati na santiṭṭhati nādhimuccati. Tassa kho evaṃ [tassa ko etaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.), evaṃ kho tassa (?) ‘‘evaṃ hi tassā bhikkhave jambāliyā’’ti pāṭho viya], bhikkhave, bhikkhuno na sakkāyanirodho pāṭikaṅkho. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, puriso lepagatena [lasagatena (sī. pī.)] hatthena sākhaṃ gaṇheyya, tassa so hattho sajjeyyapi gaṇheyyapi [gayheyyapi (?)] bajjheyyapi [khajjeyyapi (sī.)]; evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu aññataraṃ santaṃ cetovimuttiṃ upasampajja viharati. So sakkāyanirodhaṃ manasi karoti. Tassa sakkāyanirodhaṃ manasi karoto sakkāyanirodhe cittaṃ na pakkhandati nappasīdati na santiṭṭhati nādhimuccati. Tassa kho evaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno na sakkāyanirodho pāṭikaṅkho.

178.“Monks, these four kinds of persons are found existing in the world. Which four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu attains and dwells in a certain peaceful liberation of mind. He attends to the cessation of self-identity. As he attends to the cessation of self-identity, his mind does not leap forward, does not become serene, does not become steady, and is not released in the cessation of self-identity. For such a bhikkhu, bhikkhus, the cessation of self-identity is not to be expected. Just as, bhikkhus, a man with a hand smeared with birdlime would grasp a branch, and his hand would stick to it, cling to it, and be attached to it; in the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu attains and dwells in a certain peaceful liberation of mind. He attends to the cessation of self-identity. As he attends to the cessation of self-identity, his mind does not leap forward, does not become serene, does not become steady, and is not released in the cessation of self-identity. For such a bhikkhu, bhikkhus, the cessation of self-identity is not to be expected.

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu aññataraṃ santaṃ cetovimuttiṃ upasampajja viharati. So sakkāyanirodhaṃ manasi karoti. Tassa sakkāyanirodhaṃ manasi karoto sakkāyanirodhe cittaṃ pakkhandati pasīdati santiṭṭhati adhimuccati. Tassa kho evaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno sakkāyanirodho pāṭikaṅkho. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, puriso suddhena hatthena sākhaṃ gaṇheyya, tassa so hattho neva sajjeyya na gaṇheyya na bajjheyya; evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu aññataraṃ santaṃ cetovimuttiṃ upasampajja viharati. So sakkāyanirodhaṃ manasi karoti. Tassa sakkāyanirodhaṃ manasi karoto sakkāyanirodhe cittaṃ pakkhandati pasīdati santiṭṭhati adhimuccati. Tassa kho evaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno sakkāyanirodho pāṭikaṅkho.

But here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu attains and dwells in a certain peaceful liberation of mind. He attends to the cessation of self-identity. As he attends to the cessation of self-identity, his mind leaps forward, becomes serene, becomes steady, and is released in the cessation of self-identity. For such a bhikkhu, bhikkhus, the cessation of self-identity is to be expected. Just as, bhikkhus, a man with a clean hand would grasp a branch, and his hand would not stick to it, cling to it, or be attached to it; in the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu attains and dwells in a certain peaceful liberation of mind. He attends to the cessation of self-identity. As he attends to the cessation of self-identity, his mind leaps forward, becomes serene, becomes steady, and is released in the cessation of self-identity. For such a bhikkhu, bhikkhus, the cessation of self-identity is to be expected.

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu aññataraṃ santaṃ cetovimuttiṃ upasampajja viharati. So avijjāppabhedaṃ manasi karoti. Tassa avijjāppabhedaṃ manasi karoto avijjāppabhede cittaṃ na pakkhandati nappasīdati na santiṭṭhati nādhimuccati. Tassa kho evaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno na avijjāppabhedo pāṭikaṅkho. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, jambālī anekavassagaṇikā. Tassā puriso yāni ceva āyamukhāni tāni pidaheyya, yāni ca apāyamukhāni tāni vivareyya, devo ca na sammā dhāraṃ anuppaveccheyya. Evañhi tassā, bhikkhave, jambāliyā na āḷippabhedo pāṭikaṅkho. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu aññataraṃ santaṃ cetovimuttiṃ upasampajja viharati. So avijjāppabhedaṃ manasi karoti. Tassa avijjāppabhedaṃ manasi karoto avijjāppabhede cittaṃ na pakkhandati nappasīdati na santiṭṭhati nādhimuccati. Tassa kho evaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno na avijjāppabhedo pāṭikaṅkho.

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu attains and dwells in a certain peaceful liberation of mind. He attends to the breaking up of ignorance. As he attends to the breaking up of ignorance, his mind does not leap forward, does not become serene, does not become steady, and is not released in the breaking up of ignorance. For such a bhikkhu, bhikkhus, the breaking up of ignorance is not to be expected. Just as, bhikkhus, if there were a stagnant pool that had been accumulating for many years, and a man were to close up its inlets and open up its outlets, and the rain were not to pour down properly—for such a stagnant pool, bhikkhus, the breaking up of its scum is not to be expected. In the same way, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu attains and dwells in a certain peaceful liberation of mind. He attends to the breaking up of ignorance. As he attends to the breaking up of ignorance, his mind does not leap forward, does not become serene, does not become steady, and is not released in the breaking up of ignorance. For such a bhikkhu, bhikkhus, the breaking up of ignorance is not to be expected.

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhu aññataraṃ santaṃ cetovimuttiṃ upasampajja viharati. So avijjāppabhedaṃ manasi karoti. Tassa avijjāppabhedaṃ manasi karoto avijjāppabhede cittaṃ pakkhandati pasīdati santiṭṭhati adhimuccati. Tassa kho evaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno avijjāppabhedo pāṭikaṅkho. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, jambālī anekavassagaṇikā. Tassā puriso yāni ceva āyamukhāni tāni vivareyya, yāni ca apāyamukhāni tāni pidaheyya, devo ca sammā dhāraṃ anuppaveccheyya. Evañhi tassā, bhikkhave, jambāliyā āḷippabhedo pāṭikaṅkho. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu aññataraṃ santaṃ cetovimuttiṃ upasampajja viharati. So avijjāppabhedaṃ manasi karoti. Tassa avijjāppabhedaṃ manasi karoto avijjāppabhede cittaṃ pakkhandati pasīdati santiṭṭhati adhimuccati. Tassa kho evaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno avijjāppabhedo pāṭikaṅkho. Ime kho, bhikkhave, cattāro puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmi’’nti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.
