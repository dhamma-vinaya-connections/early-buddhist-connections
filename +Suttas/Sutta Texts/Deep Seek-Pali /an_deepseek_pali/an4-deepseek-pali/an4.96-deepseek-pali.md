## AN 4.96 The Discourse on the Abandoning of Lust

96. ‘‘Cattārome, bhikkhave, puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ. Katame cattāro? Attahitāya paṭipanno no parahitāya, parahitāya paṭipanno no attahitāya, nevattahitāya paṭipanno no parahitāya, attahitāya ceva paṭipanno parahitāya ca.

96.“Bhikkhus, these four persons are found existing in the world. Which four? The one who practices for his own welfare but not for the welfare of others; the one who practices for the welfare of others but not for his own welfare; the one who practices neither for his own welfare nor for the welfare of others; and the one who practices both for his own welfare and for the welfare of others.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo attahitāya paṭipanno hoti no parahitāya? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo attanā rāgavinayāya paṭipanno hoti, no paraṃ rāgavinayāya samādapeti; attanā dosavinayāya paṭipanno hoti, no paraṃ dosavinayāya samādapeti; attanā mohavinayāya paṭipanno hoti, no paraṃ mohavinayāya samādapeti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo attahitāya paṭipanno hoti, no parahitāya.

“And how, bhikkhus, is a person one who practices for his own welfare but not for the welfare of others? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person practices for the abandoning of lust in himself, but does not encourage others to abandon lust; he practices for the abandoning of hatred in himself, but does not encourage others to abandon hatred; he practices for the abandoning of delusion in himself, but does not encourage others to abandon delusion. In this way, bhikkhus, a person is one who practices for his own welfare but not for the welfare of others.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo parahitāya paṭipanno hoti, no attahitāya? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo attanā na rāgavinayāya paṭipanno hoti, paraṃ rāgavinayāya samādapeti; attanā na dosavinayāya paṭipanno hoti, paraṃ dosavinayāya samādapeti; attanā na mohavinayāya paṭipanno hoti, paraṃ mohavinayāya samādapeti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo parahitāya paṭipanno hoti, no attahitāya.

“And how, bhikkhus, is a person one who practices for the welfare of others but not for his own welfare? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person does not practice for the abandoning of lust in himself, but encourages others to abandon lust; he does not practice for the abandoning of hatred in himself, but encourages others to abandon hatred; he does not practice for the abandoning of delusion in himself, but encourages others to abandon delusion. In this way, bhikkhus, a person is one who practices for the welfare of others but not for his own welfare.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo nevattahitāya paṭipanno hoti, no parahitāya? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo attanā na rāgavinayāya paṭipanno hoti, no paraṃ rāgavinayāya samādapeti; attanā na dosavinayāya paṭipanno hoti, no paraṃ dosavinayāya samādapeti; attanā na mohavinayāya paṭipanno hoti, no paraṃ mohavinayāya samādapeti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo nevattahitāya paṭipanno hoti, no parahitāya.

“And how, bhikkhus, is a person one who practices neither for his own welfare nor for the welfare of others? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person does not practice for the abandoning of lust in himself, nor does he encourage others to abandon lust; he does not practice for the abandoning of hatred in himself, nor does he encourage others to abandon hatred; he does not practice for the abandoning of delusion in himself, nor does he encourage others to abandon delusion. In this way, bhikkhus, a person is one who practices neither for his own welfare nor for the welfare of others.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo attahitāya ceva paṭipanno hoti parahitāya ca? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo attanā ca rāgavinayāya paṭipanno hoti, parañca rāgavinayāya samādapeti; attanā ca dosavinayāya paṭipanno hoti, parañca dosavinayāya samādapeti; attanā ca mohavinayāya paṭipanno hoti, parañca mohavinayāya samādapeti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo attahitāya ceva paṭipanno hoti parahitāya ca. Ime kho, bhikkhave, cattāro puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmi’’nti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

“And how, bhikkhus, is a person one who practices both for his own welfare and for the welfare of others? Here, bhikkhus, a certain person practices for the abandoning of lust in himself, and encourages others to abandon lust; he practices for the abandoning of hatred in himself, and encourages others to abandon hatred; he practices for the abandoning of delusion in himself, and encourages others to abandon delusion. In this way, bhikkhus, a person is one who practices both for his own welfare and for the welfare of others. These, bhikkhus, are the four persons found existing in the world.” The sixth.
