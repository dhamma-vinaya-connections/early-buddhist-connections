## AN 4.109 The Tree Discourse

109. ‘‘Cattārome, bhikkhave, rukkhā. Katame cattāro? Pheggu phegguparivāro, pheggu sāraparivāro, sāro phegguparivāro, sāro sāraparivāro – ime kho, bhikkhave, cattāro rukkhā. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, cattāro rukkhūpamā puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ. Katame cattāro? Pheggu phegguparivāro, pheggu sāraparivāro, sāro phegguparivāro, sāro sāraparivāro.

109.“Monks, there are these four kinds of trees. What four? A tree that is sapwood with a sapwood retinue, a tree that is sapwood with a heartwood retinue, a tree that is heartwood with a sapwood retinue, and a tree that is heartwood with a heartwood retinue. These, monks, are the four kinds of trees. In the same way, monks, these four persons comparable to trees are found existing in the world. What four? One who is sapwood with a sapwood retinue, one who is sapwood with a heartwood retinue, one who is heartwood with a sapwood retinue, and one who is heartwood with a heartwood retinue.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo pheggu hoti phegguparivāro? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo dussīlo hoti pāpadhammo; parisāpissa hoti dussīlā pāpadhammā. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo pheggu hoti phegguparivāro. Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, rukkho pheggu phegguparivāro; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi.

“And how, monks, is a person sapwood with a sapwood retinue? Here, monks, a certain person is unvirtuous, of bad qualities; and their assembly is also unvirtuous, of bad qualities. That is how a person is sapwood with a sapwood retinue. Just as that tree is sapwood with a sapwood retinue, so too, monks, I declare this person to be comparable.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo pheggu hoti sāraparivāro? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo dussīlo hoti pāpadhammo; parisā ca khvassa hoti sīlavatī kalyāṇadhammā. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo pheggu hoti sāraparivāro. Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, rukkho pheggu sāraparivāro; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi.

“And how, monks, is a person sapwood with a heartwood retinue? Here, monks, a certain person is unvirtuous, of bad qualities; but their assembly is virtuous, of good qualities. That is how a person is sapwood with a heartwood retinue. Just as that tree is sapwood with a heartwood retinue, so too, monks, I declare this person to be comparable.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo sāro hoti phegguparivāro? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo sīlavā hoti kalyāṇadhammo; parisā ca khvassa hoti dussīlā pāpadhammā. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo sāro hoti phegguparivāro. Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, rukkho sāro phegguparivāro; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi.

“And how, monks, is a person heartwood with a sapwood retinue? Here, monks, a certain person is virtuous, of good qualities; but their assembly is unvirtuous, of bad qualities. That is how a person is heartwood with a sapwood retinue. Just as that tree is heartwood with a sapwood retinue, so too, monks, I declare this person to be comparable.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo sāro hoti sāraparivāro? Idha bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo sīlavā hoti kalyāṇadhammo; parisāpissa hoti sīlavatī kalyāṇadhammā. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo sāro hoti sāraparivāro. Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, rukkho sāro sāraparivāro; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi. Ime kho, bhikkhave, cattāro rukkhūpamā puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmi’’nti [pu. pa. 170]. Navamaṃ.

“And how, monks, is a person heartwood with a heartwood retinue? Here, monks, a certain person is virtuous, of good qualities; and their assembly is also virtuous, of good qualities. That is how a person is heartwood with a heartwood retinue. Just as that tree is heartwood with a heartwood retinue, so too, monks, I declare this person to be comparable. These, monks, are the four kinds of persons comparable to trees, found existing in the world.”
