## AN 4.61 The Discourse on Fit Action

61. Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho anāthapiṇḍikaṃ gahapatiṃ bhagavā etadavoca –

61.Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. As he was sitting to one side, the Blessed One said this to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika:

‘‘Cattārome, gahapati, dhammā iṭṭhā kantā manāpā dullabhā lokasmiṃ. Katame cattāro? Bhogā me uppajjantu sahadhammenāti, ayaṃ paṭhamo dhammo iṭṭho kanto manāpo dullabho lokasmiṃ.

“Householder, there are these four things that are desirable, agreeable, and pleasing, and hard to obtain in the world. What four? ‘May wealth come to me by righteous means!’—this is the first thing that is desirable, agreeable, and pleasing, and hard to obtain in the world.

‘‘Bhoge laddhā sahadhammena yaso me āgacchatu saha ñātīhi saha upajjhāyehīti, ayaṃ dutiyo dhammo iṭṭho kanto manāpo dullabho lokasmiṃ.

“Having obtained wealth by righteous means, may fame come to me along with my relatives and teachers!”—this is the second thing that is desirable, agreeable, and pleasing, and hard to obtain in the world.

‘‘Bhoge laddhā sahadhammena yasaṃ laddhā saha ñātīhi saha upajjhāyehi ciraṃ jīvāmi dīghamāyuṃ pālemīti, ayaṃ tatiyo dhammo iṭṭho kanto manāpo dullabho lokasmiṃ.

“Having obtained wealth by righteous means, having gained fame along with my relatives and teachers, may I live long and maintain a long life!”—this is the third thing that is desirable, agreeable, and pleasing, and hard to obtain in the world.

‘‘Bhoge laddhā sahadhammena yasaṃ laddhā saha ñātīhi saha upajjhāyehi ciraṃ jīvitvā dīghamāyuṃ pāletvā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjāmīti, ayaṃ catuttho dhammo iṭṭho kanto manāpo dullabho lokasmiṃ. Ime kho, gahapati, cattāro dhammā iṭṭhā kantā manāpā dullabhā lokasmiṃ.

“Having obtained wealth by righteous means, having gained fame along with my relatives and teachers, having lived long, having maintained a long life, with the breakup of the body, after death, may I be reborn in a happy destination, in a heavenly world!”—this is the fourth thing that is desirable, agreeable, and pleasing, and hard to obtain in the world. These, householder, are the four things that are desirable, agreeable, and pleasing, and hard to obtain in the world.

‘‘Imesaṃ kho, gahapati, catunnaṃ dhammānaṃ iṭṭhānaṃ kantānaṃ manāpānaṃ dullabhānaṃ lokasmiṃ cattāro dhammā paṭilābhāya saṃvattanti. Katame cattāro? Saddhāsampadā, sīlasampadā, cāgasampadā, paññāsampadā.

“Householder, for the attainment of these four things—desirable, agreeable, and pleasing, and hard to obtain in the world—four qualities conduce to their acquisition. What four? Accomplishment of faith, accomplishment of virtue, accomplishment of generosity, and accomplishment of wisdom.”

‘‘Katamā ca, gahapati, saddhāsampadā? Idha, gahapati, ariyasāvako saddho hoti, saddahati tathāgatassa bodhiṃ – ‘itipi so bhagavā arahaṃ sammāsambuddho vijjācaraṇasampanno sugato lokavidū anuttaro purisadammasārathi, satthā devamanussānaṃ buddho bhagavā’ti. Ayaṃ vuccati, gahapati, saddhāsampadā.

“And what, householder, is the accomplishment of faith? Here, householder, a noble disciple is faithful; he has faith in the Tathagata’s enlightenment thus: ‘Indeed, the Blessed One is an Arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One.’ This, householder, is called the accomplishment of faith.”

‘‘Katamā ca, gahapati, sīlasampadā? Idha, gahapati, ariyasāvako pāṇātipātā paṭivirato hoti…pe… surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā paṭivirato hoti. Ayaṃ vuccati, gahapati, sīlasampadā.

“And what, householder, is the accomplishment of virtue? Here, householder, a noble disciple abstains from the destruction of life…he abstains from distilled and fermented liquors that are the basis for heedlessness. This, householder, is called the accomplishment of virtue.”

‘‘Katamā ca, gahapati, cāgasampadā? Idha, gahapati, ariyasāvako vigatamalamaccherena cetasā agāraṃ ajjhāvasati muttacāgo payatapāṇi vosaggarato yācayogo dānasaṃvibhāgarato. Ayaṃ vuccati, gahapati, cāgasampadā.

“And what, householder, is the accomplishment of generosity? Here, householder, a noble disciple dwells at home with a mind rid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, open-handed, delighting in relinquishing, responsive to requests, delighting in the distribution of alms. This, householder, is called the accomplishment of generosity.”

‘‘Katamā ca, gahapati, paññāsampadā? Abhijjhāvisamalobhābhibhūtena, gahapati, cetasā viharanto akiccaṃ karoti, kiccaṃ aparādheti. Akiccaṃ karonto kiccaṃ aparādhento yasā ca sukhā ca dhaṃsati. Byāpādābhibhūtena, gahapati, cetasā viharanto akiccaṃ karoti, kiccaṃ aparādheti. Akiccaṃ karonto kiccaṃ aparādhento yasā ca sukhā ca dhaṃsati. Thinamiddhābhibhūtena, gahapati, cetasā viharanto akiccaṃ karoti kiccaṃ aparādheti. Akiccaṃ karonto kiccaṃ aparādhento yasā ca sukhā ca dhaṃsati. Uddhaccakukkuccābhibhūtena, gahapati, cetasā viharanto akiccaṃ karoti, kiccaṃ aparādheti. Akiccaṃ karonto kiccaṃ aparādhento yasā ca sukhā ca dhaṃsati. Vicikicchābhibhūtena, gahapati, cetasā viharanto akiccaṃ karoti, kiccaṃ aparādheti. Akiccaṃ karonto kiccaṃ aparādhento yasā ca sukhā ca dhaṃsati.

“And what, householder, is the accomplishment of wisdom? When, householder, one dwells with a mind overcome by covetousness and unwholesome greed, one does what should not be done and fails to do what should be done. Doing what should not be done and failing to do what should be done, one declines from fame and happiness. When, householder, one dwells with a mind overcome by ill will…by sloth and torpor…by restlessness and remorse…by doubt, one does what should not be done and fails to do what should be done. Doing what should not be done and failing to do what should be done, one declines from fame and happiness.”

‘‘Sa kho so, gahapati, ariyasāvako abhijjhāvisamalobho cittassa upakkilesoti, iti viditvā abhijjhāvisamalobhaṃ cittassa upakkilesaṃ pajahati. Byāpādo cittassa upakkilesoti, iti viditvā byāpādaṃ cittassa upakkilesaṃ pajahati. Thinamiddhaṃ cittassa upakkilesoti, iti viditvā thinamiddhaṃ cittassa upakkilesaṃ pajahati. Uddhaccakukkuccaṃ cittassa upakkilesoti, iti viditvā uddhaccakukkuccaṃ cittassa upakkilesaṃ pajahati. Vicikicchā cittassa upakkilesoti, iti viditvā vicikicchaṃ cittassa upakkilesaṃ pajahati.

“Then, householder, the noble disciple understands: ‘Covetousness and unwholesome greed are a defilement of the mind.’ Having understood it thus, he abandons that defilement of the mind. He understands: ‘Ill will is a defilement of the mind.’ Having understood it thus, he abandons that defilement of the mind. He understands: ‘Sloth and torpor are a defilement of the mind.’ Having understood it thus, he abandons that defilement of the mind. He understands: ‘Restlessness and remorse are a defilement of the mind.’ Having understood it thus, he abandons that defilement of the mind. He understands: ‘Doubt is a defilement of the mind.’ Having understood it thus, he abandons that defilement of the mind.”

‘‘Yato ca kho, gahapati, ariyasāvakassa abhijjhāvisamalobho cittassa upakkilesoti, iti viditvā abhijjhāvisamalobho cittassa upakkileso pahīno hoti. Byāpādo cittassa upakkilesoti, iti viditvā byāpādo cittassa upakkileso pahīno hoti. Thinamiddhaṃ cittassa upakkilesoti, iti viditvā thinamiddhaṃ cittassa upakkileso pahīno hoti. Uddhaccakukkuccaṃ cittassa upakkilesoti, iti viditvā uddhaccakukkuccaṃ cittassa upakkileso pahīno hoti. Vicikicchā cittassa upakkilesoti, iti viditvā vicikicchā cittassa upakkileso pahīno hoti. Ayaṃ vuccati, gahapati, ariyasāvako mahāpañño puthupañño āpātadaso [āpāthadaso (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] paññāsampanno [hāsapañño (ka.)]. Ayaṃ vuccati, gahapati, paññāsampadā. Imesaṃ kho, gahapati, catunnaṃ dhammānaṃ iṭṭhānaṃ kantānaṃ manāpānaṃ dullabhānaṃ lokasmiṃ ime cattāro dhammā paṭilābhāya saṃvattanti.

“And when, householder, for a noble disciple, covetousness and unwholesome greed are understood as a defilement of the mind, and having understood it thus, that defilement of the mind is abandoned; when ill will is understood as a defilement of the mind, and having understood it thus, that defilement of the mind is abandoned; when sloth and torpor are understood as a defilement of the mind, and having understood it thus, that defilement of the mind is abandoned; when restlessness and remorse are understood as a defilement of the mind, and having understood it thus, that defilement of the mind is abandoned; when doubt is understood as a defilement of the mind, and having understood it thus, that defilement of the mind is abandoned—then, householder, this noble disciple is called one of great wisdom, of broad wisdom, one who sees penetratingly, one accomplished in wisdom. This, householder, is called the accomplishment of wisdom. For the attainment of these four things—desirable, agreeable, and pleasing, and hard to obtain in the world—these four qualities conduce to their acquisition.”

‘‘Sa kho so, gahapati, ariyasāvako uṭṭhānavīriyādhigatehi bhogehi bāhābalaparicitehi sedāvakkhittehi dhammikehi dhammaladdhehi cattāri pattakammāni kattā hoti. Katamāni cattāri? Idha gahapati, ariyasāvako uṭṭhānavīriyādhigatehi bhogehi bāhābalaparicitehi sedāvakkhittehi dhammikehi dhammaladdhehi attānaṃ sukheti pīṇeti sammā sukhaṃ pariharati. Mātāpitaro sukheti pīṇeti sammā sukhaṃ pariharati. Puttadāradāsakammakaraporise sukheti pīṇeti sammā sukhaṃ pariharati. Mittāmacce sukheti pīṇeti sammā sukhaṃ pariharati. Idamassa paṭhamaṃ ṭhānagataṃ hoti pattagataṃ āyatanaso paribhuttaṃ.

“Householder, that noble disciple, with wealth acquired through energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteously gained, performs four fit actions. What four? Here, householder, the noble disciple, with wealth acquired through energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteously gained, makes himself happy and content, and maintains himself in proper ease. He makes his mother and father happy and content, and maintains them in proper ease. He makes his children, wife, slaves, and employees happy and content, and maintains them in proper ease. He makes his friends and companions happy and content, and maintains them in proper ease. This is his first fit action, his first proper use, his first sphere of enjoyment.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, gahapati, ariyasāvako uṭṭhānavīriyādhigatehi bhogehi bāhābalaparicitehi sedāvakkhittehi dhammikehi dhammaladdhehi yā tā honti āpadā aggito vā udakato vā rājato vā corato vā appiyato vā dāyādato [a. ni. 5.41], tathārūpāsu āpadāsu pariyodhāya saṃvattati. Sotthiṃ attānaṃ karoti. Idamassa dutiyaṃ ṭhānagataṃ hoti pattagataṃ āyatanaso paribhuttaṃ.

“Furthermore, householder, a noble disciple, with wealth acquired through energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteously gained, wards off misfortunes arising from fire, water, kings, thieves, or disliked heirs. He makes himself safe. This is his second fit action, his second proper use, his second sphere of enjoyment.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, gahapati, ariyasāvako uṭṭhānavīriyādhigatehi bhogehi bāhābalaparicitehi sedāvakkhittehi dhammikehi dhammaladdhehi pañcabaliṃ kattā hoti – ñātibaliṃ, atithibaliṃ, pubbapetabaliṃ, rājabaliṃ, devatābaliṃ. Idamassa tatiyaṃ ṭhānagataṃ hoti pattagataṃ āyatanaso paribhuttaṃ.

“Furthermore, householder, a noble disciple, with wealth acquired through energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteously gained, becomes one who makes the five offerings: offerings to relatives, offerings to guests, offerings to departed ancestors, offerings to the king, and offerings to the devas. This is his third fit action, his third proper use, his third sphere of enjoyment.”

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, gahapati, ariyasāvako uṭṭhānavīriyādhigatehi bhogehi bāhābalaparicitehi sedāvakkhittehi dhammikehi dhammaladdhehi ye te samaṇabrāhmaṇā madappamādā paṭiviratā khantisoracce niviṭṭhā ekamattānaṃ damenti, ekamattānaṃ samenti, ekamattānaṃ parinibbāpenti, tathārūpesu samaṇabrāhmaṇesu uddhaggikaṃ dakkhiṇaṃ patiṭṭhāpeti sovaggikaṃ sukhavipākaṃ saggasaṃvattanikaṃ. Idamassa catutthaṃ ṭhānagataṃ hoti pattagataṃ āyatanaso paribhuttaṃ.

Furthermore, householder, a noble disciple, having acquired wealth through energetic striving, accumulated by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous, and rightfully gained, establishes an offering that leads upwards, is conducive to heaven, results in happiness, and is conducive to rebirth in heaven, to those ascetics and brahmins who abstain from heedlessness and intoxication, are established in patience and mildness, who tame themselves, calm themselves, and bring themselves to final Nibbāna. This is the fourth instance of his wealth being well-placed, well-attained, and rightly used.

‘‘Sa kho so, gahapati, ariyasāvako uṭṭhānavīriyādhigatehi bhogehi bāhābalaparicitehi sedāvakkhittehi dhammikehi dhammaladdhehi imāni cattāri pattakammāni kattā hoti. Yassa kassaci, gahapati, aññatra imehi catūhi pattakammehi bhogā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, ime vuccanti, gahapati, bhogā aṭṭhānagatā apattagatā anāyatanaso paribhuttā. Yassa kassaci, gahapati, imehi catūhi pattakammehi bhogā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, ime vuccanti, gahapati, bhogā ṭhānagatā pattagatā āyatanaso paribhuttā’’ti.

Indeed, householder, that noble disciple, having acquired wealth through energetic striving, accumulated by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous, and rightfully gained, performs these four fit deeds. For anyone, householder, whose wealth is depleted without these four fit deeds, it is said that such wealth is ill-placed, ill-attained, and wrongly used. But for anyone, householder, whose wealth is depleted after these four fit deeds, it is said that such wealth is well-placed, well-attained, and rightly used.

‘‘Bhuttā bhogā bhatā bhaccā [gatā bhūtā (ka.) bhaṭā bhaccā (syā. kaṃ.)], vitiṇṇā āpadāsu me;Uddhaggā dakkhiṇā dinnā, atho pañcabalī katā;Upaṭṭhitā sīlavanto, saññatā brahmacārayo.

Wealth has been enjoyed, dependents supported, dangers overcome by me. Offerings leading upwards have been given, and the fivefold offerings performed. The virtuous, self-controlled, and celibate have been attended to.

‘‘Yadatthaṃ bhogaṃ iccheyya, paṇḍito gharamāvasaṃ;So me attho anuppatto, kataṃ ananutāpiyaṃ.

Whatever wealth a wise householder might desire, that purpose of mine has been attained, my duty done without regret.

‘‘Etaṃ [evaṃ (ka.)] anussaraṃ macco, ariyadhamme ṭhito naro;Idheva naṃ pasaṃsanti, pecca sagge pamodatī’’ti. paṭhamaṃ;

Remembering this, a mortal, a person established in the Noble Dhamma, here itself they praise him; departing, he rejoices in heaven.
