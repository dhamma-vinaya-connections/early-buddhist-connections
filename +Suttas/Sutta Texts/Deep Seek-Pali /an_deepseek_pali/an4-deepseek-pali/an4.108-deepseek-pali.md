# AN 4.108 Balībaddasuttaṃ

## AN 4.108 The Discourse on the Ox

108. ‘‘Cattārome, bhikkhave, balībaddā [balivaddā (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.), balibaddhā (ka.) pu. pa. 162]. Katame cattāro? Sagavacaṇḍo no paragavacaṇḍo, paragavacaṇḍo no sagavacaṇḍo, sagavacaṇḍo ca paragavacaṇḍo ca, neva sagavacaṇḍo no paragavacaṇḍo – ime kho, bhikkhave, cattāro balībaddā. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, cattāro balībaddūpamā puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ. Katame cattāro? Sagavacaṇḍo no paragavacaṇḍo, paragavacaṇḍo no sagavacaṇḍo, sagavacaṇḍo ca paragavacaṇḍo ca, neva sagavacaṇḍo no paragavacaṇḍo.

108.“Monks, there are these four kinds of oxen. What four? An ox that is fierce towards its own group but not towards another group, an ox that is fierce towards another group but not towards its own group, an ox that is fierce towards both its own group and another group, and an ox that is fierce towards neither its own group nor another group. These, monks, are the four kinds of oxen. In the same way, monks, these four persons comparable to oxen are found existing in the world. What four? One who is fierce towards their own group but not towards another group, one who is fierce towards another group but not towards their own group, one who is fierce towards both their own group and another group, and one who is fierce towards neither their own group nor another group.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo sagavacaṇḍo hoti, no paragavacaṇḍo? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo sakaparisaṃ ubbejetā hoti, no paraparisaṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo sagavacaṇḍo hoti, no paragavacaṇḍo. Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, balībaddo sagavacaṇḍo, no paragavacaṇḍo; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi.

“And how, monks, is a person fierce towards their own group, but not towards another group? Here, monks, a certain person agitates their own company, but not another company. That is how a person is fierce towards their own group, but not towards another group. Just as that ox is fierce towards its own group, but not towards another group, so too, monks, I declare this person to be comparable.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo paragavacaṇḍo hoti, no sagavacaṇḍo? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo paraparisaṃ ubbejetā hoti, no sakaparisaṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo paragavacaṇḍo hoti, no sagavacaṇḍo. Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, balībaddo paragavacaṇḍo, no sagavacaṇḍo; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi.

“And how, monks, is a person fierce towards another group, but not towards their own group? Here, monks, a certain person agitates another company, but not their own company. That is how a person is fierce towards another group, but not towards their own group. Just as that ox is fierce towards another group, but not towards its own group, so too, monks, I declare this person to be comparable.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo sagavacaṇḍo ca hoti paragavacaṇḍo ca? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo sakaparisaṃ ubbejetā hoti paraparisañca. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo sagavacaṇḍo ca hoti paragavacaṇḍo ca. Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, balībaddo sagavacaṇḍo ca paragavacaṇḍo ca; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi.

“And how, monks, is a person fierce towards their own group and towards another group? Here, monks, a certain person agitates their own company and another company. That is how a person is fierce towards their own group and towards another group. Just as that ox is fierce towards its own group and towards another group, so too, monks, I declare this person to be comparable.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo neva sagavacaṇḍo hoti no paragavacaṇḍo? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo neva sakaparisaṃ ubbejetā hoti, no paraparisañca. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo neva sagavacaṇḍo hoti, no paragavacaṇḍo. Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, balībaddo neva sagavacaṇḍo, no paragavacaṇḍo; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi. Ime kho, bhikkhave, cattāro balībaddūpamā puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmi’’nti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

“And how, monks, is a person neither fierce towards their own group nor towards another group? Here, monks, a certain person agitates neither their own company nor another company. That is how a person is neither fierce towards their own group nor towards another group. Just as that ox is neither fierce towards its own group nor towards another group, so too, monks, I declare this person to be comparable. These, monks, are the four kinds of persons comparable to oxen, found existing in the world.”
