## AN 4.78 The Offering Discourse

78. ‘‘Catasso imā, bhikkhave, dakkhiṇā visuddhiyo. Katamā catasso? Atthi, bhikkhave, dakkhiṇā dāyakato visujjhati, no paṭiggāhakato; atthi, bhikkhave, dakkhiṇā paṭiggāhakato visujjhati, no dāyakato; atthi, bhikkhave, dakkhiṇā neva dāyakato visujjhati, no paṭiggāhakato; atthi, bhikkhave, dakkhiṇā dāyakato ceva visujjhati paṭiggāhakato ca.

78."Monks, there are these four purifications of offerings. Which four? There is an offering that is purified by the giver, not by the recipient; there is an offering that is purified by the recipient, not by the giver; there is an offering that is purified neither by the giver nor by the recipient; and there is an offering that is purified both by the giver and by the recipient."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, dakkhiṇā dāyakato visujjhati, no paṭiggāhakato? Idha, bhikkhave, dāyako hoti sīlavā kalyāṇadhammo; paṭiggāhakā honti dussīlā pāpadhammā [paṭiggāhako hoti dussīlo pāpadhammo (syā. kaṃ. ka.) ma. ni. 3.381 oloketabbaṃ]. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, dakkhiṇā dāyakato visujjhati, no paṭiggāhakato.

"And how, monks, is an offering purified by the giver, not by the recipient? Here, monks, the giver is virtuous and of good qualities, while the recipients are unvirtuous and of bad qualities. It is in this way, monks, that an offering is purified by the giver, not by the recipient."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, dakkhiṇā paṭiggāhakato visujjhati, no dāyakato? Idha, bhikkhave, dāyako hoti dussīlo pāpadhammo; paṭiggāhakā honti sīlavanto kalyāṇadhammā. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, dakkhiṇā paṭiggāhakato visujjhati, no dāyakato.

"And how, monks, is an offering purified by the recipient, not by the giver? Here, monks, the giver is unvirtuous and of bad qualities, while the recipients are virtuous and of good qualities. It is in this way, monks, that an offering is purified by the recipient, not by the giver."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, dakkhiṇā neva dāyakato visujjhati, no paṭiggāhakato? Idha, bhikkhave, dāyako hoti dussīlo pāpadhammo; paṭiggāhakāpi honti dussīlā pāpadhammā. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, dakkhiṇā neva dāyakato visujjhati, no paṭiggāhakato.

"And how, monks, is an offering purified neither by the giver nor by the recipient? Here, monks, the giver is unvirtuous and of bad qualities, and the recipients are also unvirtuous and of bad qualities. It is in this way, monks, that an offering is purified neither by the giver nor by the recipient."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, dakkhiṇā dāyakato ceva visujjhati paṭiggāhakato ca? Idha, bhikkhave, dāyako hoti sīlavā kalyāṇadhammo; paṭiggāhakāpi honti sīlavanto kalyāṇadhammā. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, dakkhiṇā dāyakato ceva visujjhati paṭiggāhakato ca. Imā kho, bhikkhave, catasso dakkhiṇā visuddhiyo’’ti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

"And how, monks, is an offering purified both by the giver and by the recipient? Here, monks, the giver is virtuous and of good qualities, and the recipients are also virtuous and of good qualities. It is in this way, monks, that an offering is purified both by the giver and by the recipient. These, monks, are the four purifications of offerings." The eighth.
