## AN 4.139 The Discourse on Dhamma Speakers

139. ‘‘Cattārome, bhikkhave, dhammakathikā. Katame cattāro? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco dhammakathiko appañca bhāsati asahitañca; parisā cassa [parisā ca (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.) pu. pa. 156] na kusalā hoti sahitāsahitassa. Evarūpo, bhikkhave, dhammakathiko evarūpāya parisāya dhammakathikotveva saṅkhaṃ gacchati.

139.Monks, these four Dhamma speakers are found. Which four? Here, monks, a certain Dhamma speaker speaks little and unconnectedly; and his audience is not skilled in (distinguishing) what is connected and what is unconnected. Such a Dhamma speaker, monks, is merely reckoned a Dhamma speaker by such an audience.

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, ekacco dhammakathiko appañca bhāsati sahitañca; parisā cassa kusalā hoti sahitāsahitassa. Evarūpo, bhikkhave, dhammakathiko evarūpāya parisāya dhammakathikotveva saṅkhaṃ gacchati.

Here, monks, a certain Dhamma speaker speaks little but speaks connectedly; and his audience is skilled in (distinguishing) what is connected and what is unconnected. Such a Dhamma speaker, monks, is merely reckoned a Dhamma speaker by such an audience.

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, ekacco dhammakathiko bahuñca bhāsati asahitañca; parisā cassa na kusalā hoti sahitāsahitassa. Evarūpo, bhikkhave, dhammakathiko evarūpāya parisāya dhammakathikotveva saṅkhaṃ gacchati.

Here, monks, a certain Dhamma speaker speaks much and unconnectedly; and his audience is not skilled in (distinguishing) what is connected and what is unconnected. Such a Dhamma speaker, monks, is merely reckoned a Dhamma speaker by such an audience.
