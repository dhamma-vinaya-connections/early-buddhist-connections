# AN 4.103 Kumbhasuttaṃ

## AN 4.103 The Pot Discourse

103. ‘‘Cattārome, bhikkhave, kumbhā. Katame cattāro? Tuccho pihito, pūro vivaṭo, tuccho vivaṭo, pūro pihito – ime kho, bhikkhave, cattāro kumbhā. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, cattāro kumbhūpamā [pu. pa. 160] puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ. Katame cattāro? Tuccho pihito, pūro vivaṭo, tuccho vivaṭo, pūro pihito.

103.Monks, there are these four pots. Which four? Empty and closed, full and open, empty and open, full and closed. These, monks, are the four pots. In the same way, monks, there are four kinds of persons comparable to pots found existing in the world. Which four? Empty and closed, full and open, empty and open, full and closed.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo tuccho hoti pihito? Idha, bhikkhave, ekaccassa puggalassa pāsādikaṃ hoti abhikkantaṃ paṭikkantaṃ ālokitaṃ vilokitaṃ samiñjitaṃ pasāritaṃ saṅghāṭipattacīvaradhāraṇaṃ. So ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti…pe… ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo tuccho hoti pihito. Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, kumbho tuccho pihito; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi.

And how, monks, is a person empty and closed? Here, monks, a certain person has a pleasing manner in his going forth and returning, his looking ahead and looking around, his bending and stretching, and his wearing of the robes and carrying of the bowl. Yet he does not truly understand: ‘This is suffering’… ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’ Thus, monks, a person is empty and closed. Just as, monks, a pot is empty and closed, so do I describe this person.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo pūro hoti vivaṭo? Idha, bhikkhave, ekaccassa puggalassa na pāsādikaṃ hoti abhikkantaṃ paṭikkantaṃ ālokitaṃ vilokitaṃ samiñjitaṃ pasāritaṃ saṅghāṭipattacīvaradhāraṇaṃ. So ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti…pe… ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, puggalo pūro hoti vivaṭo. Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, kumbho pūro vivaṭo; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi.

And how, monks, is a person empty and open? Here, monks, a certain person does not have a pleasing manner in his going forth and returning, his looking ahead and looking around, his bending and stretching, and his wearing of the robes and carrying of the bowl. Nor does he truly understand: ‘This is suffering’… ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’ Thus, monks, a person is empty and open. Just as, monks, a pot is empty and open, so do I describe this person.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, puggalo pūro hoti pihito? Idha, bhikkhave, ekaccassa puggalassa pāsādikaṃ hoti abhikkantaṃ paṭikkantaṃ ālokitaṃ vilokitaṃ samiñjitaṃ pasāritaṃ saṅghāṭipattacīvaradhāraṇaṃ.

Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, kumbho pūro pihito; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi. Ime kho, bhikkhave, cattāro kumbhūpamā puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmi’’nti. Tatiyaṃ.
