## AN 4.162 The Detailed Discourse

162. ‘‘Catasso imā, bhikkhave, paṭipadā. Katamā catasso? Dukkhā paṭipadā dandhābhiññā, dukkhā paṭipadā khippābhiññā, sukhā paṭipadā dandhābhiññā, sukhā paṭipadā khippābhiññā.

162."Monks, there are these four courses of practice. What four? Painful course of practice with slow insight, painful course of practice with quick insight, pleasant course of practice with slow insight, pleasant course of practice with quick insight.

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, dukkhā paṭipadā dandhābhiññā? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco pakatiyāpi tibbarāgajātiko hoti, abhikkhaṇaṃ rāgajaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti. Pakatiyāpi tibbadosajātiko hoti, abhikkhaṇaṃ dosajaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti. Pakatiyāpi tibbamohajātiko hoti, abhikkhaṇaṃ mohajaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti. Tassimāni pañcindriyāni mudūni pātubhavanti – saddhindriyaṃ, vīriyindriyaṃ, satindriyaṃ, samādhindriyaṃ, paññindriyaṃ. So imesaṃ pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ muduttā dandhaṃ ānantariyaṃ pāpuṇāti āsavānaṃ khayāya. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, dukkhā paṭipadā dandhābhiññā.

"And what, monks, is the painful course of practice with slow insight? Here, monks, a certain person is by nature intensely passionate, and he frequently experiences pain and displeasure born of passion. He is by nature intensely hateful, and he frequently experiences pain and displeasure born of hate. He is by nature intensely deluded, and he frequently experiences pain and displeasure born of delusion. In him, these five faculties appear weak: the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of wisdom. Due to the weakness of these five faculties, he slowly attains the immediate destruction of the taints. This, monks, is called the painful course of practice with slow insight.

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, dukkhā paṭipadā khippābhiññā? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco pakatiyāpi tibbarāgajātiko hoti, abhikkhaṇaṃ rāgajaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti. Pakatiyāpi tibbadosajātiko hoti, abhikkhaṇaṃ dosajaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti. Pakatiyāpi tibbamohajātiko hoti, abhikkhaṇaṃ mohajaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti. Tassimāni pañcindriyāni adhimattāni pātubhavanti – saddhindriyaṃ, vīriyindriyaṃ, satindriyaṃ, samādhindriyaṃ, paññindriyaṃ. So imesaṃ pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ adhimattattā khippaṃ ānantariyaṃ pāpuṇāti āsavānaṃ khayāya. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, dukkhā paṭipadā khippābhiññā.

"And what, monks, is the painful course of practice with quick insight? Here, monks, a certain person is by nature intensely passionate, and he frequently experiences pain and displeasure born of passion. He is by nature intensely hateful, and he frequently experiences pain and displeasure born of hate. He is by nature intensely deluded, and he frequently experiences pain and displeasure born of delusion. In him, these five faculties appear strong: the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of wisdom. Due to the strength of these five faculties, he quickly attains the immediate destruction of the taints. This, monks, is called the painful course of practice with quick insight.

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sukhā paṭipadā dandhābhiññā? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco pakatiyāpi na tibbarāgajātiko hoti, nābhikkhaṇaṃ rāgajaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti. Pakatiyāpi na tibbadosajātiko hoti, nābhikkhaṇaṃ dosajaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti. Pakatiyāpi na tibbamohajātiko hoti, nābhikkhaṇaṃ mohajaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti. Tassimāni pañcindriyāni mudūni pātubhavanti – saddhindriyaṃ…pe… paññindriyaṃ. So imesaṃ pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ muduttā dandhaṃ ānantariyaṃ pāpuṇāti āsavānaṃ khayāya. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, sukhā paṭipadā dandhābhiññā.

"And what, monks, is the pleasant course of practice with slow insight? Here, monks, a certain person is by nature not intensely passionate, and he does not frequently experience pain and displeasure born of passion. He is by nature not intensely hateful, and he does not frequently experience pain and displeasure born of hate. He is by nature not intensely deluded, and he does not frequently experience pain and displeasure born of delusion. In him, these five faculties appear weak: the faculty of faith... up to the faculty of wisdom. Due to the weakness of these five faculties, he slowly attains the immediate destruction of the taints. This, monks, is called the pleasant course of practice with slow insight.

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sukhā paṭipadā khippābhiññā? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco pakatiyāpi na tibbarāgajātiko hoti, nābhikkhaṇaṃ rāgajaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti.
