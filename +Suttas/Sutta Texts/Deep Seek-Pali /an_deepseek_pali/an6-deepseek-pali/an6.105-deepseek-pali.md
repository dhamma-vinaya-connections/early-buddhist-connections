## AN 6.105 The Discourse on Becoming

105. ‘‘Tayome, bhikkhave, bhavā pahātabbā, tīsu sikkhāsu sikkhitabbaṃ. Katame tayo bhavā pahātabbā? Kāmabhavo, rūpabhavo, arūpabhavo – ime tayo bhavā pahātabbā. Katamāsu tīsu sikkhāsu sikkhitabbaṃ? Adhisīlasikkhāya, adhicittasikkhāya, adhipaññāsikkhāya – imāsu tīsu sikkhāsu sikkhitabbaṃ. Yato kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno ime tayo bhavā pahīnā honti, imāsu ca tīsu sikkhāsu sikkhitasikkho hoti – ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, bhikkhu acchecchi taṇhaṃ, vivattayi saṃyojanaṃ, sammā mānābhisamayā antamakāsi dukkhassā’’ti. Dasamaṃ.

105."Monks, there are these three kinds of becoming to be abandoned, and one must train in the three trainings. Which three kinds of becoming are to be abandoned? Becoming in the realm of sensual desire, becoming in the realm of form, and becoming in the formless realm—these three kinds of becoming are to be abandoned. In which three trainings must one train? In the higher training of moral conduct, the higher training of mind, and the higher training of wisdom—one must train in these three trainings. When, monks, a monk has abandoned these three kinds of becoming and is well-trained in these three trainings, he is called, monks, a monk who has cut off craving, unraveled the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit, has made an end of suffering." The tenth.
