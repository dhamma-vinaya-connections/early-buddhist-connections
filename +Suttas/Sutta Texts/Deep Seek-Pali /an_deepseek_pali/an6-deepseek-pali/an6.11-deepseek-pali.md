# AN 6.11 Paṭhamasāraṇīyasuttaṃ

## AN 6.11 The First Discourse on Amiability

11. ‘‘Chayime, bhikkhave, dhammā sāraṇīyā [sārāṇīyā (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)]. Katame cha? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno mettaṃ kāyakammaṃ paccupaṭṭhitaṃ hoti sabrahmacārīsu āvi ceva raho ca, ayampi dhammo sāraṇīyo.

11. "Monks, there are these six qualities that are conducive to amiability, to mutual esteem, to non-dispute, to concord, to unity. What six? Here, monks, a monk maintains bodily acts of loving-kindness towards his fellow celibates, both in public and in private. This too is a quality that is conducive to amiability, to mutual esteem, to non-dispute, to concord, to unity.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno mettaṃ vacīkammaṃ paccupaṭṭhitaṃ hoti sabrahmacārīsu āvi ceva raho ca, ayampi dhammo sāraṇīyo.

"Furthermore, monks, a monk maintains verbal acts of loving-kindness towards his fellow celibates, both in public and in private. This too is a quality that is conducive to amiability, to mutual esteem, to non-dispute, to concord, to unity."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno mettaṃ manokammaṃ paccupaṭṭhitaṃ hoti sabrahmacārīsu āvi ceva raho ca, ayampi dhammo sāraṇīyo.

Furthermore, monks, a monk maintains mental acts of loving-kindness towards his fellow celibates, both in public and in private. This too is a quality that is conducive to amiability, to mutual esteem, to non-dispute, to concord, to unity.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ye te lābhā dhammikā dhammaladdhā antamaso pattapariyāpannamattampi tathārūpehi lābhehi appaṭivibhattabhogī hoti sīlavantehi sabrahmacārīhi sādhāraṇabhogī, ayampi dhammo sāraṇīyo.

"Furthermore, monks, a monk shares without reservation any lawful gains he has obtained righteously, even the mere contents of his alms bowl, with virtuous fellow monastic companions; he enjoys such gains in common with them. This too is a quality that is conducive to amiability, to mutual esteem, to non-dispute, to concord, to unity."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu yāni tāni sīlāni akhaṇḍāni acchiddāni asabalāni akammāsāni bhujissāni viññuppasatthāni aparāmaṭṭhāni samādhisaṃvattanikāni tathārūpehi sīlehi sīlasāmaññagato viharati sabrahmacārīhi āvi ceva raho ca, ayampi dhammo sāraṇīyo.

"Furthermore, monks, a monk dwells maintaining such virtues as are unbroken, untorn, unblemished, unmottled, liberating, praised by the wise, untainted, conducive to concentration; and he dwells sharing those virtues in common with his fellow celibates, both in public and in private. This too is a quality that is conducive to amiability, to mutual esteem, to non-dispute, to concord, to unity."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu yāyaṃ diṭṭhi ariyā niyyānikā niyyāti takkarassa sammā dukkhakkhayāya tathārūpāya diṭṭhiyā diṭṭhisāmaññagato viharati sabrahmacārīhi āvi ceva raho ca, ayampi dhammo sāraṇīyo. Ime kho, bhikkhave, cha dhammā sāraṇīyā’’ti. Paṭhamaṃ.

Furthermore, monks, a monk dwells sharing in common with his fellow celibates, both in public and in private, that view which is noble, emancipating, leading to the destruction of suffering for one who acts according to it. This too is a quality that is conducive to amiability, to mutual esteem, to non-dispute, to concord, to unity. These, monks, are the six qualities that are conducive to amiability, to mutual esteem, to non-dispute, to concord, to unity. (First)
