# AN 6.50 Indriyasaṃvarasuttaṃ

## AN 6.50 The Discourse on Sense Restraint

50. [a. ni. 5.24, 168; 2.7.65] ‘‘Indriyasaṃvare, bhikkhave, asati indriyasaṃvaravipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti sīlaṃ; sīle asati sīlavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti sammāsamādhi; sammāsamādhimhi asati sammāsamādhivipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ; yathābhūtañāṇadassane asati yathābhūtañāṇadassanavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti nibbidāvirāgo; nibbidāvirāge asati nibbidāvirāgavipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, rukkho sākhāpalāsavipanno. Tassa papaṭikāpi na pāripūriṃ gacchati, tacopi na pāripūriṃ gacchati, pheggupi na pāripūriṃ gacchati, sāropi na pāripūriṃ gacchati. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, indriyasaṃvare asati indriyasaṃvaravipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti sīlaṃ…pe… vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ.

50.“Bhikkhus, when sense restraint is absent, for one deficient in sense restraint, virtue has its foundation cut off. When virtue is absent, for one deficient in virtue, right concentration has its foundation cut off. When right concentration is absent, for one deficient in right concentration, knowledge and vision of things as they are has its foundation cut off. When knowledge and vision of things as they are is absent, for one deficient in knowledge and vision of things as they are, disenchantment and dispassion have their foundation cut off. When disenchantment and dispassion are absent, for one deficient in disenchantment and dispassion, the knowledge and vision of liberation has its foundation cut off. Just as, bhikkhus, a tree lacking branches and foliage—its outer bark does not reach fullness, nor its inner bark, nor its softwood, nor its heartwood. In the same way, bhikkhus, when sense restraint is absent, for one deficient in sense restraint, virtue has its foundation cut off…the knowledge and vision of liberation.”

‘‘Indriyasaṃvare, bhikkhave, sati indriyasaṃvarasampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti sīlaṃ; sīle sati sīlasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti sammāsamādhi; sammāsamādhimhi sati sammāsamādhisampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ; yathābhūtañāṇadassane sati yathābhūtañāṇadassanasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti nibbidāvirāgo; nibbidāvirāge sati nibbidāvirāgasampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, rukkho sākhāpalāsasampanno. Tassa papaṭikāpi pāripūriṃ gacchati, tacopi pāripūriṃ gacchati, pheggupi pāripūriṃ gacchati, sāropi pāripūriṃ gacchati. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, indriyasaṃvare sati indriyasaṃvarasampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti sīlaṃ…pe… vimuttiñāṇadassana’’nti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

“Bhikkhus, when sense restraint is present, for one endowed with sense restraint, virtue is endowed with its foundation. When virtue is present, for one endowed with virtue, right concentration is endowed with its foundation. When right concentration is present, for one endowed with right concentration, knowledge and vision of things as they are is endowed with its foundation. When knowledge and vision of things as they are is present, for one endowed with knowledge and vision of things as they are, disenchantment and dispassion are endowed with their foundation. When disenchantment and dispassion are present, for one endowed with disenchantment and dispassion, the knowledge and vision of liberation is endowed with its foundation. Just as, bhikkhus, a tree endowed with branches and foliage—its outer bark reaches fullness, its inner bark reaches fullness, its softwood reaches fullness, its heartwood reaches fullness. In the same way, bhikkhus, when sense restraint is present, for one endowed with sense restraint, virtue is endowed with its foundation…the knowledge and vision of liberation.” The eighth.
