## AN 6.25 The Discourse on the Grounds for Recollection

25. ‘‘Chayimāni, bhikkhave, anussatiṭṭhānāni. Katamāni cha? Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako tathāgataṃ anussarati – ‘itipi so bhagavā…pe… satthā devamanussānaṃ buddho bhagavā’ti. Yasmiṃ, bhikkhave, samaye ariyasāvako tathāgataṃ anussarati, nevassa tasmiṃ samaye rāgapariyuṭṭhitaṃ cittaṃ hoti, na dosapariyuṭṭhitaṃ cittaṃ hoti, na mohapariyuṭṭhitaṃ cittaṃ hoti; ujugatamevassa tasmiṃ samaye cittaṃ hoti, nikkhantaṃ muttaṃ vuṭṭhitaṃ gedhamhā. ‘Gedho’ti kho, bhikkhave, pañcannetaṃ kāmaguṇānaṃ adhivacanaṃ. Idampi kho, bhikkhave, ārammaṇaṃ karitvā evamidhekacce sattā visujjhanti.

25.“Bhikkhus, there are these six grounds for recollection. Which six? Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata: ‘Indeed, the Blessed One is Arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One.’ When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata, at that time his mind is not overwhelmed by lust, nor by hatred, nor by delusion. At that time, his mind is straightened, gone forth, freed, and released from greed. ‘Greed,’ bhikkhus, is a designation for the five cords of sensual pleasure. Bhikkhus, by making this an object, some beings here are purified.”

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako dhammaṃ anussarati – ‘svākkhāto bhagavatā dhammo…pe… paccattaṃ veditabbo viññūhī’ti. Yasmiṃ, bhikkhave, samaye ariyasāvako dhammaṃ anussarati, nevassa tasmiṃ samaye rāgapariyuṭṭhitaṃ cittaṃ hoti, na dosapariyuṭṭhitaṃ cittaṃ hoti, na mohapariyuṭṭhitaṃ cittaṃ hoti; ujugatamevassa tasmiṃ samaye cittaṃ hoti, nikkhantaṃ muttaṃ vuṭṭhitaṃ gedhamhā. ‘Gedho’ti kho, bhikkhave, pañcannetaṃ kāmaguṇānaṃ adhivacanaṃ. Idampi kho, bhikkhave, ārammaṇaṃ karitvā evamidhekacce sattā visujjhanti.

“Furthermore, bhikkhus, a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma: ‘The Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, visible here and now, immediate, inviting one to come and see, onward-leading, to be personally experienced by the wise.’ When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma, at that time his mind is not overwhelmed by lust, nor by hatred, nor by delusion. At that time, his mind is straightened, gone forth, freed, and released from greed. ‘Greed,’ bhikkhus, is a designation for the five cords of sensual pleasure. Bhikkhus, by making this an object, some beings here are purified.”

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako saṅghaṃ anussarati – ‘suppaṭipanno bhagavato sāvakasaṅgho…pe… anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassā’ti. Yasmiṃ, bhikkhave, samaye ariyasāvako saṅghaṃ anussarati, nevassa tasmiṃ samaye rāgapariyuṭṭhitaṃ cittaṃ hoti, na dosapariyuṭṭhitaṃ cittaṃ hoti, na mohapariyuṭṭhitaṃ cittaṃ hoti; ujugatamevassa tasmiṃ samaye cittaṃ hoti, nikkhantaṃ muttaṃ vuṭṭhitaṃ gedhamhā. ‘Gedho’ti kho, bhikkhave, pañcannetaṃ kāmaguṇānaṃ adhivacanaṃ. Idampi kho, bhikkhave, ārammaṇaṃ karitvā evamidhekacce sattā visujjhanti.

“Furthermore, bhikkhus, a noble disciple recollects the Sangha: ‘The Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practicing the good way; the Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practicing the straight way; the Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practicing the wise way; the Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practicing the dutiful way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals—this Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.’ When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple recollects the Sangha, at that time his mind is not overwhelmed by lust, nor by hatred, nor by delusion. At that time, his mind is straightened, gone forth, freed, and released from greed. ‘Greed,’ bhikkhus, is a designation for the five cords of sensual pleasure. Bhikkhus, by making this an object, some beings here are purified.”

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako attano sīlāni anussarati akhaṇḍāni…pe… samādhisaṃvattanikāni. Yasmiṃ, bhikkhave, samaye ariyasāvako sīlaṃ anussarati, nevassa tasmiṃ samaye rāgapariyuṭṭhitaṃ cittaṃ hoti, na dosapariyuṭṭhitaṃ cittaṃ hoti, na mohapariyuṭṭhitaṃ cittaṃ hoti; ujugatamevassa tasmiṃ samaye cittaṃ hoti, nikkhantaṃ muttaṃ vuṭṭhitaṃ gedhamhā. ‘Gedho’ti kho, bhikkhave, pañcannetaṃ kāmaguṇānaṃ adhivacanaṃ. Idampi kho, bhikkhave, ārammaṇaṃ karitvā evamidhekacce sattā visujjhanti.

“Furthermore, bhikkhus, a noble disciple recollects his own virtues: ‘unbroken, untorn, unblemished, unmottled, liberating, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration.’ When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple recollects his virtue, at that time his mind is not overwhelmed by lust, nor by hatred, nor by delusion. At that time, his mind is straightened, gone forth, freed, and released from greed. ‘Greed,’ bhikkhus, is a designation for the five cords of sensual pleasure. Bhikkhus, by making this an object, some beings here are purified.”

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako attano cāgaṃ anussarati – ‘lābhā vata me! Suladdhaṃ vata me…pe… yācayogo dānasaṃvibhāgarato’ti. Yasmiṃ…pe… evamidhekacce sattā visujjhanti.

“Furthermore, bhikkhus, a noble disciple recollects his own generosity: ‘It is truly my gain! It is truly well gained by me, that among a generation afflicted by the stain of stinginess, I dwell with a mind free from the stain of stinginess, open-handed, pure-handed, delighting in relinquishment, responsive to requests, delighting in the sharing of gifts.’ When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple recollects his generosity, at that time his mind is not overwhelmed by lust, nor by hatred, nor by delusion. At that time, his mind is straightened, gone forth, freed, and released from greed. ‘Greed,’ bhikkhus, is a designation for the five cords of sensual pleasure. Bhikkhus, by making this an object, some beings here are purified.”

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako devatā anussarati – ‘santi devā cātumahārājikā, santi devā tāvatiṃsā, santi devā yāmā, santi devā tusitā, santi devā nimmānaratino, santi devā paranimmitavasavattino, santi devā brahmakāyikā, santi devā tatuttari. Yathārūpāya saddhāya samannāgatā tā devatā ito cutā tattha upapannā; mayhampi tathārūpā saddhā saṃvijjati. Yathārūpena sīlena… sutena… cāgena… paññāya samannāgatā tā devatā ito cutā tattha upapannā; mayhampi tathārūpā paññā saṃvijjatī’’’ ti.

“Furthermore, bhikkhus, a noble disciple recollects the deities: ‘There are the devas of the Four Great Kings, the devas of the Thirty-three, the Yama devas, the Tusita devas, the devas who delight in creation, the devas who wield power over others’ creations, the devas of Brahmā’s host, and devas beyond them. With whatever kind of faith they were endowed, those deities, on passing away from here, were reborn there; I too have faith of that kind. With whatever kind of virtue they were endowed, those deities, on passing away from here, were reborn there; I too have virtue of that kind. With whatever kind of learning they were endowed, those deities, on passing away from here, were reborn there; I too have learning of that kind. With whatever kind of generosity they were endowed, those deities, on passing away from here, were reborn there; I too have generosity of that kind. With whatever kind of wisdom they were endowed, those deities, on passing away from here, were reborn there; I too have wisdom of that kind.’

‘‘Yasmiṃ, bhikkhave, samaye ariyasāvako attano ca tāsañca devatānaṃ saddhañca sīlañca sutañca cāgañca paññañca anussarati nevassa tasmiṃ samaye rāgapariyuṭṭhitaṃ cittaṃ hoti, na dosapariyuṭṭhitaṃ cittaṃ hoti, na mohapariyuṭṭhitaṃ cittaṃ hoti; ujugatamevassa tasmiṃ samaye cittaṃ hoti, nikkhantaṃ muttaṃ vuṭṭhitaṃ gedhamhā. ‘Gedho’ti kho, bhikkhave, pañcannetaṃ kāmaguṇānaṃ adhivacanaṃ. Idampi kho, bhikkhave, ārammaṇaṃ karitvā evamidhekacce sattā visujjhanti. Imāni kho, bhikkhave, cha anussatiṭṭhānānī’’ti. Pañcamaṃ.

“When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple recollects his own faith, virtue, learning, generosity, and wisdom, and those of those deities, at that time his mind is not overwhelmed by lust, nor by hatred, nor by delusion. At that time, his mind is straightened, gone forth, freed, and released from greed. ‘Greed,’ bhikkhus, is a designation for the five cords of sensual pleasure. Bhikkhus, by making this an object, some beings here are purified. These, bhikkhus, are the six grounds for recollection.” Fifth.
