# AN 6.1 Paṭhamaāhuneyyasuttaṃ

## AN 6.1 The First Discourse on Those Worthy of Offerings

1. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘bhikkhavo’’ti. ‘‘Bhadante’’ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca –

1. Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks!" "Venerable sir," those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

‘‘Chahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu āhuneyyo hoti pāhuneyyo dakkhiṇeyyo añjalikaraṇīyo anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassa. Katamehi chahi [dī. ni. 3.328; paṭi. ma. 3.17]? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu cakkhunā rūpaṃ disvā neva sumano hoti na dummano, upekkhako viharati sato sampajāno. Sotena saddaṃ sutvā neva sumano hoti na dummano, upekkhako viharati sato sampajāno. Ghānena gandhaṃ ghāyitvā neva sumano hoti na dummano, upekkhako viharati sato sampajāno. Jivhāya rasaṃ sāyitvā neva sumano hoti na dummano, upekkhako viharati sato sampajāno. Kāyena phoṭṭhabbaṃ phusitvā neva sumano hoti na dummano, upekkhako viharati sato sampajāno. Manasā dhammaṃ viññā neva sumano hoti na dummano, upekkhako viharati sato sampajāno. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, chahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu āhuneyyo hoti pāhuneyyo dakkhiṇeyyo añjalikaraṇīyo anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassā’’ti.

"Monks, a monk endowed with six qualities is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What six? Here, monks, a monk, having seen a form with the eye, is neither glad nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending. Having heard a sound with the ear, he is neither glad nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending. Having smelled an odor with the nose, he is neither glad nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending. Having tasted a flavor with the tongue, he is neither glad nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending. Having touched a tangible object with the body, he is neither glad nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending. Having cognized a mental object with the mind, he is neither glad nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending. Monks, a monk endowed with these six qualities is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."

Idamavoca bhagavā. Attamanā te bhikkhū bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinandunti. Paṭhamaṃ.

Thus spoke the Blessed One. The monks were satisfied and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words. The first.
