# AN 6.59 Dārukammikasuttaṃ

## AN 6.59 The Woodworker Discourse.

59. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā nātike viharati giñjakāvasathe. Atha kho dārukammiko gahapati yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho dārukammikaṃ gahapatiṃ bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘api nu te, gahapati, kule dānaṃ dīyatī’’ti? ‘‘Dīyati me, bhante, kule dānaṃ. Tañca kho ye te bhikkhū āraññikā piṇḍapātikā paṃsukūlikā arahanto vā arahattamaggaṃ vā samāpannā, tathārūpesu me, bhante, bhikkhūsu dānaṃ dīyatī’’ti.

59.Thus have I heard – at one time the Blessed One was staying at Nātika in the Giñjakāvasatha. Then the householder Dārukammika approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One said to the householder Dārukammika: "Householder, is alms given in your family?" "Alms are given in my family, venerable sir. And it is given to those monks who are forest dwellers, alms-goers, rag-robe wearers, arahants or those who have entered the path to arahantship. Such monks, venerable sir, receive alms in my family."

‘‘Dujjānaṃ kho etaṃ, gahapati, tayā gihinā kāmabhoginā puttasambādhasayanaṃ ajjhāvasantena, kāsikacandanaṃ paccanubhontena, mālāgandhavilepanaṃ dhārayantena, jātarūparajataṃ sādiyantena ime vā arahanto ime vā arahattamaggaṃ samāpannāti.

"Householder, it is difficult for you, living as a householder enjoying sensual pleasures, dwelling amidst a household crowded with children, using sandalwood from Kāsī, enjoying garlands, perfumes, and unguents, and accepting gold and silver, to know: 'These are arahants or these are those who have entered the path to arahantship.'"

‘‘Āraññiko cepi, gahapati, bhikkhu hoti uddhato unnaḷo capalo mukharo vikiṇṇavāco muṭṭhassati asampajāno asamāhito vibbhantacitto pākatindriyo. Evaṃ so tenaṅgena gārayho. Āraññiko cepi, gahapati, bhikkhu hoti anuddhato anunnaḷo acapalo amukharo avikiṇṇavāco upaṭṭhitassati sampajāno samāhito ekaggacitto saṃvutindriyo. Evaṃ so tenaṅgena pāsaṃso.

"If a monk who lives in the forest, householder, is arrogant, conceited, fickle, talkative, scattering his words, forgetful, uncomprehending, unconcentrated, with a confused mind, and undisciplined in his senses, then he is blameworthy for that reason. If a monk who lives in the forest, householder, is not arrogant, not conceited, not fickle, not talkative, not scattering his words, with mindfulness established, comprehending, concentrated, with unified mind, and disciplined in his senses, then he is praiseworthy for that reason."

‘‘Gāmantavihārī cepi, gahapati, bhikkhu hoti uddhato…pe… evaṃ so tenaṅgena gārayho. Gāmantavihārī cepi, gahapati, bhikkhu hoti anuddhato…pe… evaṃ so tenaṅgena pāsaṃso.

"Even if a monk, householder, lives near a village and is unrestrained... in this way he is blameworthy because of that quality. Even if a monk, householder, lives near a village and is restrained... in this way he is praiseworthy because of that quality."

‘‘Piṇḍapātiko cepi, gahapati, bhikkhu hoti uddhato…pe… evaṃ so tenaṅgena gārayho. Piṇḍapātiko cepi, gahapati, bhikkhu hoti anuddhato…pe… evaṃ so tenaṅgena pāsaṃso.

"Even if, householder, a monk who lives on alms is restless... in this way he is blameworthy for that quality. Even if, householder, a monk who lives on alms is not restless... in this way he is praiseworthy for that quality."

‘‘Nemantaniko cepi, gahapati, bhikkhu hoti uddhato…pe… evaṃ so tenaṅgena gārayho. Nemantaniko cepi, gahapati, bhikkhu hoti anuddhato…pe… evaṃ so tenaṅgena pāsaṃso.

"If a monk, householder, is one who accepts invitations and is unrestrained... in this way he is blameworthy by that factor. If a monk, householder, is one who accepts invitations and is restrained... in this way he is praiseworthy by that factor."

‘‘Paṃsukūliko cepi, gahapati, bhikkhu hoti uddhato…pe… evaṃ so tenaṅgena gārayho. Paṃsukūliko cepi, gahapati, bhikkhu hoti anuddhato…pe… evaṃ so tenaṅgena pāsaṃso.

"Even if a monk who wears rag-robes is restless, householder ... in this way he is blameworthy for that quality. Even if a monk who wears rag-robes is not restless, householder ... in this way he is praiseworthy for that quality."

‘‘Gahapaticīvaradharo cepi, gahapati, bhikkhu hoti uddhato unnaḷo capalo mukharo vikiṇṇavāco muṭṭhassati asampajāno asamāhito vibbhantacitto pākatindriyo. Evaṃ so tenaṅgena gārayho. Gahapaticīvaradharo cepi, gahapati, bhikkhu hoti anuddhato anunnaḷo acapalo amukharo avikiṇṇavāco upaṭṭhitassati sampajāno samāhito ekaggacitto saṃvutindriyo. Evaṃ so tenaṅgena pāsaṃso.

"Even if a monk, householder, wears the robes of a householder, if he is arrogant, haughty, unsteady, garrulous, scattering his words, forgetful, lacking clear comprehension, unconcentrated, with a bewildered mind, and undisciplined senses—then he is to be criticized for that quality. Even if a monk, householder, wears the robes of a householder, if he is not arrogant, not haughty, not unsteady, not garrulous, not scattering his words, with mindfulness established, possessing clear comprehension, concentrated, with a unified mind, and with controlled senses—then he is to be praised for that quality."

‘‘Iṅgha tvaṃ, gahapati, saṅghe dānaṃ [dānāni (ka.)] dehi. Saṅghe te dānaṃ dadato cittaṃ pasīdissati. So tvaṃ pasannacitto kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjissasī’’ti. ‘‘Esāhaṃ, bhante, ajjatagge saṅghe dānaṃ dassāmī’’ti. Pañcamaṃ.

"Come, householder, give alms to the Sangha. Giving alms to the Sangha will please your mind. With a pleased mind, after the breakup of the body, after death, you will be reborn in a good destination, a heavenly world.""From today onwards, venerable sir, I will give alms to the Sangha." Fifth.
