79. ‘‘Chahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu abhabbo anadhigataṃ vā kusalaṃ dhammaṃ adhigantuṃ, adhigataṃ vā kusalaṃ dhammaṃ phātiṃ kātuṃ [phātikattuṃ (sī.), phātikātuṃ (syā. kaṃ. pī.)]. Katamehi chahi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na āyakusalo ca hoti, na apāyakusalo ca hoti, na upāyakusalo ca hoti, anadhigatānaṃ kusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ adhigamāya na chandaṃ janeti, adhigate kusale dhamme na ārakkhati [sārakkhati (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī)], sātaccakiriyāya na sampādeti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, chahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu abhabbo anadhigataṃ vā kusalaṃ dhammaṃ adhigantuṃ, adhigataṃ vā kusalaṃ dhammaṃ phātiṃ kātuṃ.

79.“Monks, a monk endowed with six qualities is incapable of achieving wholesome qualities he has not yet attained or of developing wholesome qualities he has attained. What six? Here, monks, a monk is unskilled in gain, unskilled in loss, unskilled in means; he does not generate desire for achieving wholesome qualities he has not yet attained; he does not protect wholesome qualities he has attained; and he does not bring them to fulfillment by sustained effort. Monks, a monk endowed with these six qualities is incapable of achieving wholesome qualities he has not yet attained or of developing wholesome qualities he has attained.”
