## AN 6.3 The Faculty Discourse

3. ‘‘Chahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu āhuneyyo hoti…pe… anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassa. Katamehi chahi? Saddhindriyena, vīriyindriyena, satindriyena, samādhindriyena, paññindriyena, āsavānaṃ khayā anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharati. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, chahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu āhuneyyo hoti pāhuneyyo dakkhiṇeyyo añjalikaraṇīyo anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassā’’ti. Tatiyaṃ.

3. "Monks, a monk endowed with six qualities is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What are the six? The faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, the faculty of wisdom; and through the destruction of the taints, having realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, he enters and dwells in it. Monks, a monk endowed with these six qualities is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world." The third.
