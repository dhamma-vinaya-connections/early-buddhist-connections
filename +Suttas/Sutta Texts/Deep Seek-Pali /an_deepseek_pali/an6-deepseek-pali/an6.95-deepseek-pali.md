It is impossible for a person endowed with right view to revert to the view that pleasure and pain are made by another. It is impossible for a person endowed with right view to revert to the view that pleasure and pain are both self-made and made by another. It is impossible for a person endowed with right view to revert to the view that pleasure and pain are not self-made and fortuitously arisen. It is impossible for a person endowed with right view to revert to the view that pleasure and pain are not made by another and fortuitously arisen. It is impossible for a person endowed with right view to revert to the view that pleasure and pain are neither self-made nor made by another and fortuitously arisen. Why is that? Because, monks, for a person endowed with right view, the cause is well seen and the phenomena arisen from a cause are well seen. These, monks, are the six incapable things.” Eleventh.
