# AN 6.71 Sakkhibhabbasuttaṃ

## AN 6.71 The Discourse on What Is Realizable

71. ‘‘Chahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu abhabbo tatra tatreva sakkhibhabbataṃ pāpuṇituṃ sati sati āyatane. Katamehi chahi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ‘ime hānabhāgiyā dhammā’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti, ‘ime ṭhitibhāgiyā dhammā’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti, ‘ime visesabhāgiyā dhammā’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti, ‘ime nibbedhabhāgiyā dhammā’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti, asakkaccakārī ca hoti, asappāyakārī ca. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, chahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu abhabbo tatra tatreva sakkhibhabbataṃ pāpuṇituṃ sati sati āyatane.

71.“Monks, a bhikkhu endowed with six qualities is incapable of attaining direct knowledge in each and every instance, wherever there is an opportunity. What six? Here, monks, a bhikkhu does not understand as it actually is: ‘These are qualities that lead to decline’; he does not understand as it actually is: ‘These are qualities that lead to stability’; he does not understand as it actually is: ‘These are qualities that lead to distinction’; he does not understand as it actually is: ‘These are qualities that lead to penetration.’ And he acts without due care, and he acts unsuitably. Monks, a bhikkhu endowed with these six qualities is incapable of attaining direct knowledge in each and every instance, wherever there is an opportunity.”

‘‘Chahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu bhabbo tatra tatreva sakkhibhabbataṃ pāpuṇituṃ sati sati āyatane. Katamehi chahi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ‘ime hānabhāgiyā dhammā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, ‘ime ṭhitibhāgiyā dhammā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, ‘ime visesabhāgiyā dhammā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, ‘ime nibbedhabhāgiyā dhammā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, sakkaccakārī ca hoti, sappāyakārī ca. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, chahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu bhabbo tatra tatreva sakkhibhabbataṃ pāpuṇituṃ sati sati āyatane’’ti. Sattamaṃ.

“Monks, a bhikkhu endowed with six qualities is capable of attaining direct knowledge in each and every instance, wherever there is an opportunity. What six? Here, monks, a bhikkhu understands as it actually is: ‘These are qualities that lead to decline’; he understands as it actually is: ‘These are qualities that lead to stability’; he understands as it actually is: ‘These are qualities that lead to distinction’; he understands as it actually is: ‘These are qualities that lead to penetration.’ And he acts with due care, and he acts suitably. Monks, a bhikkhu endowed with these six qualities is capable of attaining direct knowledge in each and every instance, wherever there is an opportunity.” The seventh.
