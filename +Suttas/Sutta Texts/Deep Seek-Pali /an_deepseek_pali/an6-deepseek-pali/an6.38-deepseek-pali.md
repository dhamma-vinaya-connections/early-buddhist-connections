# AN 6.38 Attakārīsuttaṃ

## AN 6.38 The Discourse on Self-Agency

38. Atha kho aññataro brāhmaṇo yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavatā saddhiṃ sammodi. Sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho so brāhmaṇo bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘ahañhi, bho gotama, evaṃvādī evaṃdiṭṭhi – ‘natthi attakāro, natthi parakāro’’’ti. ‘‘Māhaṃ, brāhmaṇa, evaṃvādiṃ evaṃdiṭṭhiṃ addasaṃ vā assosiṃ vā. Kathañhi nāma sayaṃ abhikkamanto, sayaṃ paṭikkamanto evaṃ vakkhati – ‘natthi attakāro, natthi parakāro’’’ti!

38.Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One. He exchanged greetings with the Blessed One, and when they had concluded their courteous and amiable talk, he sat down to one side. When he was seated, that brahmin said to the Blessed One: “Venerable Gotama, I am one who speaks and holds this view: ‘There is no self-agency, there is no other-agency.’” “Brahmin, I have never seen or heard anyone who speaks and holds such a view. How can one who advances by himself, retreats by himself, say: ‘There is no self-agency, there is no other-agency’?”

‘‘Taṃ kiṃ maññasi, brāhmaṇa, atthi ārabbhadhātū’’ti? ‘‘Evaṃ, bho’’. ‘‘Ārabbhadhātuyā sati ārabbhavanto sattā paññāyantī’’ti? ‘‘Evaṃ, bho’’. ‘‘Yaṃ kho, brāhmaṇa, ārabbhadhātuyā sati ārabbhavanto sattā paññāyanti, ayaṃ sattānaṃ attakāro ayaṃ parakāro’’.

“What do you think, brahmin, is there an element of undertaking?” “Yes, Venerable sir.” “When there is an element of undertaking, are beings who undertake discerned?” “Yes, Venerable sir.” “Brahmin, when beings who undertake are discerned owing to the element of undertaking, this is the self-agency of beings, this is their other-agency.”

‘‘Taṃ kiṃ maññasi, brāhmaṇa, atthi nikkamadhātu…pe… atthi parakkamadhātu… atthi thāmadhātu… atthi ṭhitidhātu… atthi upakkamadhātū’’ti? ‘‘Evaṃ, bho’’. ‘‘Upakkamadhātuyā sati upakkamavanto sattā paññāyantī’’ti? ‘‘Evaṃ, bho’’. ‘‘Yaṃ kho, brāhmaṇa, upakkamadhātuyā sati upakkamavanto sattā paññāyanti, ayaṃ sattānaṃ attakāro ayaṃ parakāro’’.

“What do you think, brahmin, is there an element of exertion… an element of striving… an element of vigor… an element of steadfastness… an element of enterprise?” “Yes, Venerable sir.” “When there is an element of enterprise, are beings who undertake enterprise discerned?” “Yes, Venerable sir.” “Brahmin, when beings who undertake enterprise are discerned owing to the element of enterprise, this is the self-agency of beings, this is their other-agency.”

‘‘Māhaṃ, brāhmaṇa [taṃ kiṃ maññasi brāhmaṇa māhaṃ (ka.)], evaṃvādiṃ evaṃdiṭṭhiṃ addasaṃ vā assosiṃ vā. Kathañhi nāma sayaṃ abhikkamanto sayaṃ paṭikkamanto evaṃ vakkhati – ‘natthi attakāro natthi parakāro’’’ti.

“Brahmin, I have never seen or heard anyone who speaks and holds such a view. How can one who advances by himself, retreats by himself, say: ‘There is no self-agency, there is no other-agency’?”

‘‘Abhikkantaṃ, bho gotama…pe… ajjatagge pāṇupetaṃ saraṇaṃ gata’’nti! Aṭṭhamaṃ.

“Magnificent, Venerable sir! Magnificent! Just as if he were to set upright what had been overturned, to disclose what was hidden, to point out the way to one who was lost, or to light a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyesight could see forms—in the same way has the Venerable Gotama made the Dhamma clear in various ways. I go for refuge to the Venerable Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. From today onwards, may the Venerable Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” This is the eighth.
