## AN 6.61 The Middle Discourse

61. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā bārāṇasiyaṃ viharati isipatane migadāye. Tena kho pana samayena sambahulānaṃ therānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ pacchābhattaṃ piṇḍapātapaṭikkantānaṃ maṇḍalamāḷe sannisinnānaṃ sannipatitānaṃ ayamantarākathā udapādi – ‘‘vuttamidaṃ, āvuso, bhagavatā pārāyane metteyyapañhe –

61.Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Bārāṇasī, in the Deer Park at Isipatana. Now at that time, after the meal, on returning from their alms round, a number of elder bhikkhus had gathered and were sitting together in the pavilion. This discussion arose among them: “Friends, this was said by the Blessed One in the Metteyya’s Questions of the Pārāyana:

[cūḷani. tissamitteyyamāṇavapucchā 67] ‘‘Yo ubhonte viditvāna, majjhe mantā na lippati [na limpati (ka.)];Taṃ brūmi mahāpurisoti, sodha sibbini [sibbani (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] maccagā’’ti.

‘Having known both ends, by wisdom he is not stained by the middle; him I call a great man—he has crossed over the seamstress here.’

‘‘Katamo nu kho, āvuso, eko anto, katamo dutiyo anto, kiṃ majjhe, kā sibbinī’’ti? Evaṃ vutte aññataro bhikkhu there bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘phasso kho, āvuso, eko anto, phassasamudayo dutiyo anto, phassanirodho majjhe, taṇhā sibbinī; taṇhā hi naṃ sibbati tassa tasseva bhavassa abhinibbattiyā. Ettāvatā kho, āvuso, bhikkhu abhiññeyyaṃ abhijānāti, pariññeyyaṃ parijānāti, abhiññeyyaṃ abhijānanto [abhijānitvā (ka.)] pariññeyyaṃ parijānanto [parijānitvā (ka.)] diṭṭheva dhamme dukkhassantakaro hotī’’ti.

“Friends, what is one end, what is the second end, what is the middle, and what is the seamstress?” When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus: “Friends, contact is one end, the origin of contact is the second end, the cessation of contact is the middle, and craving is the seamstress; for craving sews him to the arising of this or that state of existence. To this extent, friends, a bhikkhu directly knows what is to be directly known, and fully understands what is to be fully understood. Directly knowing what is to be directly known, and fully understanding what is to be fully understood, he in this very life makes an end of suffering.”

Evaṃ vutte aññataro bhikkhu there bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘atītaṃ kho, āvuso, eko anto, anāgataṃ dutiyo anto, paccuppannaṃ majjhe, taṇhā sibbinī; taṇhā hi naṃ sibbati tassa tasseva bhavassa abhinibbattiyā. Ettāvatā kho, āvuso, bhikkhu abhiññeyyaṃ abhijānāti, pariññeyyaṃ parijānāti, abhiññeyyaṃ abhijānanto, pariññeyyaṃ parijānanto diṭṭheva dhamme dukkhassantakaro hotī’’ti.

When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to those bhikkhus: “Friends, the past is one end, the future is the second end, the present is the middle, and craving is the seamstress; for craving sews him to the arising of this or that state of existence. To this extent, friends, a bhikkhu directly knows what is to be directly known, and fully understands what is to be fully understood. Directly knowing what is to be directly known, and fully understanding what is to be fully understood, he in this very life makes an end of suffering.”

Evaṃ vutte aññataro bhikkhu there bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘sukhā, āvuso, vedanā eko anto, dukkhā vedanā dutiyo anto, adukkhamasukhā vedanā majjhe, taṇhā sibbinī; taṇhā hi naṃ sibbati tassa tasseva bhavassa abhinibbattiyā. Ettāvatā kho, āvuso, bhikkhu abhiññeyyaṃ abhijānāti, pariññeyyaṃ parijānāti, abhiññeyyaṃ abhijānanto, pariññeyyaṃ parijānanto diṭṭheva dhamme dukkhassantakaro hotī’’ti.

When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus: “Friends, pleasant feeling is one end, painful feeling is the second end, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling is the middle, and craving is the seamstress; for craving sews him to the arising of this or that state of existence. To this extent, friends, a bhikkhu directly knows what is to be directly known, and fully understands what is to be fully understood. Directly knowing what is to be directly known, and fully understanding what is to be fully understood, he in this very life makes an end of suffering.”

Evaṃ vutte aññataro bhikkhu there bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘nāmaṃ kho, āvuso, eko anto, rūpaṃ dutiyo anto, viññāṇaṃ majjhe, taṇhā sibbinī; taṇhā hi naṃ sibbati tassa tasseva bhavassa abhinibbattiyā. Ettāvatā kho, āvuso, bhikkhu abhiññeyyaṃ abhijānāti, pariññeyyaṃ parijānāti, abhiññeyyaṃ abhijānanto pariññeyyaṃ parijānanto diṭṭheva dhamme dukkhassantakaro hotī’’ti.

When this was said, another bhikkhu said to those bhikkhus: “Friends, name is one end, form is the second end, consciousness is the middle, and craving is the seamstress; for craving sews him to the arising of this or that state of existence. To this extent, friends, a bhikkhu directly knows what is to be directly known, and fully understands what is to be fully understood. Directly knowing what is to be directly known, and fully understanding what is to be fully understood, he in this very life makes an end of suffering.”

Evaṃ vutte aññataro bhikkhu there bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘cha kho, āvuso, ajjhattikāni āyatanāni eko anto, cha bāhirāni āyatanāni dutiyo anto, viññāṇaṃ majjhe, taṇhā sibbinī; taṇhā hi naṃ sibbati tassa tasseva bhavassa abhinibbattiyā. Ettāvatā kho āvuso, bhikkhu abhiññeyyaṃ abhijānāti, pariññeyyaṃ parijānāti, abhiññeyyaṃ abhijānanto pariññeyyaṃ parijānanto diṭṭheva dhamme dukkhassantakaro hotī’’ti.

When this was said, another bhikkhu said to those bhikkhus: “Friends, the six internal sense bases are one end, the six external sense bases are the second end, consciousness is the middle, and craving is the seamstress; for craving sews him to the arising of this or that state of existence. To this extent, friends, a bhikkhu directly knows what is to be directly known, and fully understands what is to be fully understood. Directly knowing what is to be directly known, and fully understanding what is to be fully understood, he in this very life makes an end of suffering.”

Evaṃ vutte aññataro bhikkhu there bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘sakkāyo kho, āvuso, eko anto, sakkāyasamudayo dutiyo anto, sakkāyanirodho majjhe, taṇhā sibbinī; taṇhā hi naṃ sibbati tassa tasseva bhavassa abhinibbattiyā. Ettāvatā kho, āvuso, bhikkhu abhiññeyyaṃ abhijānāti, pariññeyyaṃ parijānāti, abhiññeyyaṃ abhijānanto pariññeyyaṃ parijānanto [sabbatthapi evameva dissati] diṭṭheva dhamme dukkhassantakaro hotī’’ti.

When this was said, another bhikkhu said to those bhikkhus: “Friends, identity is one end, the origin of identity is the second end, the cessation of identity is the middle, and craving is the seamstress; for craving sews him to the arising of this or that state of existence. To this extent, friends, a bhikkhu directly knows what is to be directly known, and fully understands what is to be fully understood. Directly knowing what is to be directly known, and fully understanding what is to be fully understood, he in this very life makes an end of suffering.”

Evaṃ vutte aññataro bhikkhu there bhikkhū etadavoca – ‘‘byākataṃ kho, āvuso, amhehi sabbeheva yathāsakaṃ paṭibhānaṃ. Āyāmāvuso, yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamissāma; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocessāma. Yathā no bhagavā byākarissati tathā naṃ dhāressāmā’’ti. ‘‘Evamāvuso’’ti kho therā bhikkhū tassa bhikkhuno paccassosuṃ. Atha kho therā bhikkhū yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu. Ekamantaṃ nisinnā kho therā bhikkhū yāvatako ahosi sabbeheva saddhiṃ kathāsallāpo, taṃ sabbaṃ bhagavato ārocesuṃ. ‘‘Kassa nu kho, bhante, subhāsita’’nti? ‘‘Sabbesaṃ vo, bhikkhave, subhāsitaṃ pariyāyena, api ca yaṃ mayā sandhāya bhāsitaṃ pārāyane metteyyapañhe –

When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus: “Friends, we have all spoken according to our own understanding. Come, friends, let us go to the Blessed One and report this matter to him. As the Blessed One explains it, so shall we bear it in mind.” “Yes, friend,” the elder bhikkhus replied to that bhikkhu. Then the elder bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the elder bhikkhus reported to the Blessed One the entire conversation they had had together. “Venerable sir, whose statement is well spoken?” “Monks, all of you have spoken well in a way; but listen to what I said with reference to the question of Metteyya in the Pārāyana:

‘‘Yo ubhonte viditvāna, majjhe mantā na lippati;Taṃ brūmi mahāpurisoti, sodha sibbinimaccagā’’ti.

“Having known both ends, by wisdom he is not stained by the middle; him I call a great man—he has crossed over the seamstress here.”

‘‘Taṃ suṇātha, sādhukaṃ manasi karotha; bhāsissāmī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti kho therā bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘phasso kho, bhikkhave, eko anto, phassasamudayo dutiyo anto, phassanirodho majjhe, taṇhā sibbinī; taṇhā hi naṃ sibbati tassa tasseva bhavassa abhinibbattiyā. Ettāvatā kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu abhiññeyyaṃ abhijānāti, pariññeyyaṃ parijānāti, abhiññeyyaṃ abhijānanto pariññeyyaṃ parijānanto diṭṭheva dhamme dukkhassantakaro hotī’’ti. Sattamaṃ.

“Monks, listen and attend carefully; I will speak.” “Yes, venerable sir,” the elder bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this: “Monks, contact is one end, the origin of contact is the second end, the cessation of contact is the middle, and craving is the seamstress; for craving sews him to the arising of this or that state of existence. To this extent, monks, a bhikkhu directly knows what is to be directly known, and fully understands what is to be fully understood. Directly knowing what is to be directly known, and fully understanding what is to be fully understood, he in this very life makes an end of suffering.” The Seventh.
