## AN 5.17 The First Discourse on Welfare

17. ‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu attahitāya paṭipanno hoti, no parahitāya. Katamehi pañcahi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu attanā sīlasampanno hoti, no paraṃ sīlasampadāya samādapeti; attanā samādhisampanno hoti, no paraṃ samādhisampadāya samādapeti; attanā paññāsampanno hoti, no paraṃ paññāsampadāya samādapeti; attanā vimuttisampanno hoti, no paraṃ vimuttisampadāya samādapeti; attanā vimuttiñāṇadassanasampanno hoti, no paraṃ vimuttiñāṇadassanasampadāya samādapeti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi aṅgehi samannāgato bhikkhu attahitāya paṭipanno hoti, no parahitāyā’’ti. Sattamaṃ.

17. "Monks, a monk endowed with five qualities is practicing for his own benefit, not for the benefit of others. What five? Here, monks, a monk is himself accomplished in moral conduct but does not encourage others in accomplishment in moral conduct; he is himself accomplished in concentration but does not encourage others in accomplishment in concentration; he is himself accomplished in wisdom but does not encourage others in accomplishment in wisdom; he is himself accomplished in liberation but does not encourage others in accomplishment in liberation; he is himself accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation but does not encourage others in accomplishment in the knowledge and vision of liberation. Monks, a monk endowed with these five qualities is practicing for his own benefit, not for the benefit of others." The seventh.
