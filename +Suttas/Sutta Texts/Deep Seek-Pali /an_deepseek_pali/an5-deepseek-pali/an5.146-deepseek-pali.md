## AN 5.146 The Friend Discourse

146. ‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu mitto na sevitabbo. Katamehi pañcahi? Kammantaṃ kāreti, adhikaraṇaṃ ādiyati, pāmokkhesu bhikkhūsu paṭiviruddho hoti, dīghacārikaṃ anavatthacārikaṃ [avatthānacārikaṃ (syā.)] anuyutto viharati, nappaṭibalo hoti kālena kālaṃ dhammiyā kathāya sandassetuṃ samādapetuṃ samuttejetuṃ sampahaṃsetuṃ. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu mitto na sevitabbo.

146."Monks, a monk endowed with five qualities should not be associated with as a friend. Which five? He makes one do work; he takes up disputes; he is opposed to the foremost monks; he indulges in long and unsettled wandering; and he is incapable of instructing, urging, inspiring, and gladdening with a Dhamma talk at the proper time. Monks, a monk endowed with these five qualities should not be associated with as a friend."

"Monks, a monk endowed with five qualities should be cultivated as a friend. Which five? He does not make one do work; he does not take up disputes; he is not opposed to the foremost monks; he does not indulge in long and unsettled wandering; and he is capable of instructing, urging, inspiring, and gladdening with a Dhamma talk at the proper time. Monks, a monk endowed with these five qualities should be cultivated as a friend."
