164. [a. ni. 5.65] Tatra kho āyasmā sāriputto bhikkhū āmantesi…pe… ‘‘pañcahi, āvuso, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃsājīvo sabrahmacārīnaṃ. Katamehi pañcahi? Idhāvuso, bhikkhu attanā ca sīlasampanno hoti, sīlasampadākathāya ca āgataṃ pañhaṃ byākattā hoti; attanā ca samādhisampanno hoti, samādhisampadākathāya ca āgataṃ pañhaṃ byākattā hoti; attanā ca paññāsampanno hoti, paññāsampadākathāya ca āgataṃ pañhaṃ byākattā hoti; attanā ca vimuttisampanno hoti, vimuttisampadākathāya ca āgataṃ pañhaṃ byākattā hoti; attanā ca vimuttiñāṇadassanasampanno hoti, vimuttiñāṇadassanasampadākathāya ca āgataṃ pañhaṃ byākattā hoti. Imehi kho, āvuso, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃsājīvo sabrahmacārīna’’nti. Catutthaṃ.

164.Thereupon the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus… "Friends, a bhikkhu endowed with five qualities is fit for his fellow bhikkhus to live with. What five? Here, friends, a bhikkhu is himself accomplished in virtue and is able to answer a question that has arisen concerning accomplishment in virtue; he is himself accomplished in concentration and is able to answer a question that has arisen concerning accomplishment in concentration; he is himself accomplished in wisdom and is able to answer a question that has arisen concerning accomplishment in wisdom; he is himself accomplished in liberation and is able to answer a question that has arisen concerning accomplishment in liberation; he is himself accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation and is able to answer a question that has arisen concerning accomplishment in the knowledge and vision of liberation. Friends, a bhikkhu endowed with these five qualities is fit for his fellow bhikkhus to live with." Fourth.
