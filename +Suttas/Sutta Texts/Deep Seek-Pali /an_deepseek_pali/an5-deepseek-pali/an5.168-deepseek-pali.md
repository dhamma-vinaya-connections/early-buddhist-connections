## AN 5.168 The Discourse on Virtue

168. Tatra kho āyasmā sāriputto bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘dussīlassa, āvuso, sīlavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti sammāsamādhi; sammāsamādhimhi asati sammāsamādhivipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ; yathābhūtañāṇadassane asati yathābhūtañāṇadassanavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti nibbidāvirāgo; nibbidāvirāge asati nibbidāvirāgavipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ. Seyyathāpi, āvuso, rukkho sākhāpalāsavipanno. Tassa papaṭikāpi na pāripūriṃ gacchati, tacopi …pe… pheggupi… sāropi na pāripūriṃ gacchati. Evamevaṃ kho, āvuso, dussīlassa sīlavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti sammāsamādhi; sammāsamādhimhi asati sammāsamādhivipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ; yathābhūtañāṇadassane asati yathābhūtañāṇadassanavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti nibbidāvirāgo; nibbidāvirāge asati nibbidāvirāgavipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ.

168.There, the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: “Friends, for one who is immoral, whose virtue is impaired, right concentration lacks its supporting condition. When right concentration is absent, for one whose right concentration is impaired, knowledge and vision of things as they really are lacks its supporting condition. When knowledge and vision of things as they really are is absent, for one whose knowledge and vision of things as they really are is impaired, disillusionment and dispassion lack their supporting condition. When disillusionment and dispassion are absent, for one whose disillusionment and dispassion are impaired, the knowledge and vision of emancipation lack their supporting condition. Just as, friends, a tree whose branches and foliage are ruined—its outer bark does not come to full development, nor its inner bark... nor its sapwood... nor its heartwood. In the same way, friends, for one who is immoral, whose virtue is impaired, right concentration lacks its supporting condition. When right concentration is absent, for one whose right concentration is impaired, knowledge and vision of things as they really are lacks its supporting condition. When knowledge and vision of things as they really are is absent, for one whose knowledge and vision of things as they really are is impaired, disillusionment and dispassion lack their supporting condition. When disillusionment and dispassion are absent, for one whose disillusionment and dispassion are impaired, the knowledge and vision of emancipation lack their supporting condition.”

‘‘Sīlavato, āvuso, sīlasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti sammāsamādhi; sammāsamādhimhi sati sammāsamādhisampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ; yathābhūtañāṇadassane sati yathābhūtañāṇadassanasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti nibbidāvirāgo; nibbidāvirāge sati nibbidāvirāgasampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ. Seyyathāpi, āvuso, rukkho, sākhāpalāsasampanno. Tassa papaṭikāpi pāripūriṃ gacchati, tacopi…pe… pheggupi… sāropi pāripūriṃ gacchati. Evamevaṃ kho, āvuso, sīlavato sīlasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti sammāsamādhi; sammāsamādhimhi sati sammāsamādhisampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ; yathābhūtañāṇadassane sati yathābhūtañāṇadassanasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti nibbidāvirāgo; nibbidāvirāge sati nibbidāvirāgasampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti vimuttiñāṇadassana’’nti [a. ni. 5.168; 6.50; 7.65]. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

“Friends, for one who is virtuous, whose virtue is accomplished, right concentration has its supporting condition. When right concentration is present, for one whose right concentration is accomplished, knowledge and vision of things as they really are has its supporting condition. When knowledge and vision of things as they really are is present, for one whose knowledge and vision of things as they really are is accomplished, disillusionment and dispassion have their supporting condition. When disillusionment and dispassion are present, for one whose disillusionment and dispassion are accomplished, the knowledge and vision of emancipation has its supporting condition. Just as, friends, a tree whose branches and foliage are accomplished—its outer bark also comes to full development, its inner bark... its sapwood... its heartwood also comes to full development. In the same way, friends, for one who is virtuous, whose virtue is accomplished, right concentration has its supporting condition. When right concentration is present, for one whose right concentration is accomplished, knowledge and vision of things as they really are has its supporting condition. When knowledge and vision of things as they really are is present, for one whose knowledge and vision of things as they really are is accomplished, disillusionment and dispassion have their supporting condition. When disillusionment and dispassion are present, for one whose disillusionment and dispassion are accomplished, the knowledge and vision of emancipation has its supporting condition.” Eighth.
