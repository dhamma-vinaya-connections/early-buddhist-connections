# AN 5.193 Saṅgāravasuttaṃ

## AN 5.193 The Discourse to Saṅgārava.

193. Atha kho saṅgāravo brāhmaṇo yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavatā saddhiṃ sammodi. Sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho saṅgāravo brāhmaṇo bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘ko nu kho, bho gotama, hetu ko paccayo, yena kadāci dīgharattaṃ sajjhāyakatāpi mantā nappaṭibhanti, pageva asajjhāyakatā? Ko pana, bho gotama, hetu ko paccayo, yena kadāci dīgharattaṃ asajjhāyakatāpi mantā paṭibhanti, pageva sajjhāyakatā’’ti?

193.Then the brahmin Saṅgārava approached the Blessed One. On arrival, he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One. When they had concluded their courteous and amiable talk, he sat down to one side. When he was seated, the brahmin Saṅgārava said to the Blessed One: “What, Master Gotama, is the cause, what is the reason, why sometimes even Vedic hymns that have been recited for a long time do not occur to one, how much more so those not recited? And what, Master Gotama, is the cause, what is the reason, why sometimes even Vedic hymns that have not been recited for a long time do occur to one, how much more so those that have been recited?”

‘‘Yasmiṃ, brāhmaṇa, samaye kāmarāgapariyuṭṭhitena cetasā viharati kāmarāgaparetena, uppannassa ca kāmarāgassa nissaraṇaṃ yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti, attatthampi tasmiṃ samaye yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti na passati, paratthampi tasmiṃ samaye yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti na passati, ubhayatthampi tasmiṃ samaye yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti na passati, dīgharattaṃ sajjhāyakatāpi mantā nappaṭibhanti, pageva asajjhāyakatā.

“Brahmin, when one dwells with a mind obsessed by sensual desire, overwhelmed by sensual desire, and does not truly understand the escape from arisen sensual desire, at that time one does not truly know or see what is for one’s own benefit, nor does one truly know or see what is for the benefit of others, nor does one truly know or see what is for the benefit of both. Even Vedic hymns that have been recited for a long time do not occur to one, how much more so those not recited.

Furthermore, brahmin, when one dwells with a mind not overcome by sloth and torpor... Suppose, brahmin, there is a bowl of water not covered with algae and duckweed.

Furthermore, brahmin, when one dwells with a mind not overcome by restlessness and remorse...

Furthermore, brahmin, when one dwells with a mind not overcome by doubt, not obsessed by doubt, and understands as it truly is the escape from arisen doubt—at that time, one knows and sees one’s own benefit as it truly is, the benefit of others as it truly is, and the benefit of both as it truly is. Even mantras long unrecited come to mind, all the more so those well-recited. Suppose, brahmin, there is a bowl of water clear, lucid, and undisturbed, placed in the light. There, a man with good eyesight, looking at his own face's reflection, would know and see it as it actually is. Just so, brahmin, when one dwells with a mind not overcome by doubt, not obsessed by doubt, and understands as it truly is the escape from arisen doubt—at that time, one knows and sees one’s own benefit as it truly is, the benefit of others... and the benefit of both as it truly is. Even mantras long unrecited come to mind, all the more so those well-recited.

‘‘Ayaṃ kho, brāhmaṇa, hetu ayaṃ paccayo, yena kadāci dīgharattaṃ sajjhāyakatāpi mantā nappaṭibhanti, pageva asajjhāyakatā. Ayaṃ pana, brāhmaṇa, hetu ayaṃ paccayo, yena kadāci dīgharattaṃ asajjhāyakatāpi mantā paṭibhanti, pageva sajjhāyakatā’’ti.

This, brahmin, is the cause, this is the reason, why sometimes even mantras long recited do not come to mind, how much less those not recited. But this, brahmin, is the cause, this is the reason, why sometimes even mantras long unrecited come to mind, how much more those recited.

‘‘Abhikkantaṃ, bho gotama…pe… upāsakaṃ maṃ bhavaṃ gotamo dhāretu ajjatagge pāṇupetaṃ saraṇaṃ gata’’nti. Tatiyaṃ.

Magnificent, Master Gotama!... Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life, from today onwards.
