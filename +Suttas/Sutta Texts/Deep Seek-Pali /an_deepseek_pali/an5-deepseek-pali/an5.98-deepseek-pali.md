# AN 5.98 Āraññakasuttaṃ

## AN 5.98 The Discourse on the Forest Dweller

98. ‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu ānāpānassatiṃ bahulīkaronto nacirasseva akuppaṃ paṭivijjhati. Katamehi pañcahi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu appaṭṭho hoti appakicco subharo susantoso jīvitaparikkhāresu; appāhāro hoti anodarikattaṃ anuyutto; appamiddho hoti jāgariyaṃ anuyutto; āraññako hoti pantasenāsano; yathāvimuttaṃ cittaṃ paccavekkhati. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu ānāpānassatiṃ bahulīkaronto nacirasseva akuppaṃ paṭivijjhatī’’ti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

98.“Monks, a monk endowed with five qualities, cultivating mindfulness of breathing, will soon penetrate the unshakable. What five? Here, monks, a monk has few wants and few duties, is easy to support, and is content with the requisites of life; he eats little, devoted to not filling his belly; he is of little sleep, devoted to wakefulness; he is a forest dweller, one who frequents remote lodgings; he reviews his mind as it is liberated. Monks, a monk endowed with these five qualities, cultivating mindfulness of breathing, will soon penetrate the unshakable.” The eighth.
