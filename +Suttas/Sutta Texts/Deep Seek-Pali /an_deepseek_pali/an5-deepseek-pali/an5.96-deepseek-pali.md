# AN 5.96 Sutadharasuttaṃ

## AN 5.96 The Discourse on One Who Retains the Teachings

96. ‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu ānāpānassatiṃ āsevanto nacirasseva akuppaṃ paṭivijjhati. Katamehi pañcahi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu appaṭṭho hoti appakicco subharo susantoso jīvitaparikkhāresu; appāhāro hoti anodarikattaṃ anuyutto; appamiddho hoti jāgariyaṃ anuyutto; bahussuto hoti sutadharo sutasannicayo, ye te dhammā ādikalyāṇā majjhekalyāṇā pariyosānakalyāṇā sātthaṃ sabyañjanaṃ kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ parisuddhaṃ brahmacariyaṃ abhivadanti, tathārūpāssa dhammā bahussutā honti dhātā vacasā paricitā manasānupekkhitā diṭṭhiyā suppaṭividdhā; yathāvimuttaṃ cittaṃ paccavekkhati. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu ānāpānassatiṃ āsevanto nacirasseva akuppaṃ paṭivijjhatī’’ti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

96."Monks, endowed with five qualities, a monk cultivating mindfulness of breathing attains the unshakeable in no long time. What five? Here, monks, a monk has few undertakings, has few duties, is easy to support, and is content with the requisites of life. He eats little and is not given to gluttony; he is not given to sloth and torpor and is devoted to wakefulness. He is learned, retains what he has heard, and accumulates what he has heard; those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure holy life—such teachings he has learned much of, retained, verbally familiar with, mentally considered, and penetrated well by view. He reviews the mind as it is liberated. Endowed with these five qualities, monks, a monk cultivating mindfulness of breathing attains the unshakeable in no long time." Sixth.
