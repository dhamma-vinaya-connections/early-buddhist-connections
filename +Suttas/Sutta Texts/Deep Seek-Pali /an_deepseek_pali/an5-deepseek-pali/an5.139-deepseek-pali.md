## AN 5.139 The Incapable Discourse

139. ‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgato rañño nāgo na rājāraho hoti na rājabhoggo, na rañño aṅgaṃtveva saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Katamehi pañcahi? Idha, bhikkhave, rañño nāgo akkhamo hoti rūpānaṃ, akkhamo saddānaṃ, akkhamo gandhānaṃ, akkhamo rasānaṃ, akkhamo phoṭṭhabbānaṃ.

139.Bhikkhus, a royal elephant endowed with five qualities is not worthy of a king, not fit for a king's use, and is not reckoned as an element of kingship. Which five? Here, bhikkhus, a royal elephant is incapable of enduring forms, incapable of enduring sounds, incapable of enduring smells, incapable of enduring tastes, and incapable of enduring tactile objects.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, rañño nāgo akkhamo hoti rūpānaṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, rañño nāgo saṅgāmagato hatthikāyaṃ vā disvā assakāyaṃ vā disvā rathakāyaṃ vā disvā pattikāyaṃ vā disvā saṃsīdati visīdati, na santhambhati na sakkoti saṅgāmaṃ otarituṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, rañño nāgo akkhamo hoti rūpānaṃ.

And how, bhikkhus, is a royal elephant incapable of enduring forms? Here, bhikkhus, when a royal elephant has gone into battle, upon seeing an elephant division, a cavalry division, a chariot division, or an infantry division, he sinks down and despairs, does not brace himself, and is unable to enter the battle. Thus, bhikkhus, a royal elephant is incapable of enduring forms.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, rañño nāgo akkhamo hoti saddānaṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, rañño nāgo saṅgāmagato hatthisaddaṃ vā sutvā assasaddaṃ vā sutvā rathasaddaṃ vā sutvā pattisaddaṃ vā sutvā bheripaṇavasaṅkhatiṇavaninnādasaddaṃ vā sutvā saṃsīdati visīdati, na santhambhati na sakkoti saṅgāmaṃ otarituṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, rañño nāgo akkhamo hoti saddānaṃ.

And how, bhikkhus, is a royal elephant incapable of enduring sounds? Here, bhikkhus, when a royal elephant has gone into battle, on hearing the sound of elephants, the sound of horses, the sound of chariots, the sound of infantry, or the sound of drums, tabors, conches, and kettledrums, he sinks down and despairs, does not brace himself, and is unable to enter the battle. Thus, bhikkhus, a royal elephant is incapable of enduring sounds.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, rañño nāgo akkhamo hoti gandhānaṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, rañño nāgo saṅgāmagato ye te rañño nāgā abhijātā saṅgāmāvacarā tesaṃ muttakarīsassa gandhaṃ ghāyitvā saṃsīdati visīdati, na santhambhati na sakkoti saṅgāmaṃ otarituṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, rañño nāgo akkhamo hoti gandhānaṃ.

And how, bhikkhus, is a royal elephant incapable of enduring smells? Here, bhikkhus, when a royal elephant has gone into battle, upon smelling the dung and urine of those well-bred royal elephants accustomed to battle, he sinks down and despairs, does not brace himself, and is unable to enter the battle. Thus, bhikkhus, a royal elephant is incapable of enduring smells.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, rañño nāgo akkhamo hoti rasānaṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, rañño nāgo saṅgāmagato ekissā vā tiṇodakadattiyā vimānito [vihanīto (syā.), vihānito (katthaci)] dvīhi vā tīhi vā catūhi vā pañcahi vā tiṇodakadattīhi vimānito saṃsīdati visīdati, na santhambhati na sakkoti saṅgāmaṃ otarituṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, rañño nāgo akkhamo hoti rasānaṃ.

And how, bhikkhus, is a royal elephant incapable of enduring tastes? Here, bhikkhus, when a royal elephant has gone into battle, upon being deprived of one portion of grass and water, or two, three, four, or five portions of grass and water, he sinks down and despairs, does not brace himself, and is unable to enter the battle. Thus, bhikkhus, a royal elephant is incapable of enduring tastes.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, rañño nāgo akkhamo hoti phoṭṭhabbānaṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, rañño nāgo saṅgāmagato ekena vā saravegena viddho, dvīhi vā tīhi vā catūhi vā pañcahi vā saravegehi viddho saṃsīdati visīdati, na santhambhati na sakkoti saṅgāmaṃ otarituṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, rañño nāgo akkhamo hoti phoṭṭhabbānaṃ.

And how, bhikkhus, is a royal elephant incapable of enduring tactile objects? Here, bhikkhus, when a royal elephant has gone into battle, upon being struck by one arrow-shot, or two, three, four, or five arrow-shots, he sinks down and despairs, does not brace himself, and is unable to enter the battle. Thus, bhikkhus, a royal elephant is incapable of enduring tactile objects.

‘‘Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi aṅgehi samannāgato rañño nāgo na rājāraho hoti na rājabhoggo na rañño aṅgaṃtveva saṅkhaṃ gacchati.

Bhikkhus, a royal elephant endowed with these five qualities is not worthy of a king, not fit for a king's use, and is not reckoned as an element of kingship.

‘‘Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi aṅgehi samannāgato bhikkhu na āhuneyyo hoti na pāhuneyyo na dakkhiṇeyyo na añjalikaraṇīyo na anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassa. Katamehi pañcahi?
