## AN 5.19 The Third Discourse on Benefit

19. ‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu neva attahitāya paṭipanno hoti, no parahitāya. Katamehi pañcahi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu attanā na sīlasampanno hoti, no paraṃ sīlasampadāya samādapeti; attanā na samādhisampanno hoti, no paraṃ samādhisampadāya samādapeti; attanā na paññāsampanno hoti, no paraṃ paññāsampadāya samādapeti; attanā na vimuttisampanno hoti, no paraṃ vimuttisampadāya samādapeti; attanā na vimuttiñāṇadassanasampanno hoti, no paraṃ vimuttiñāṇadassanasampadāya samādapeti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu neva attahitāya paṭipanno hoti, no parahitāyā’’ti. Navamaṃ.

19. "Monks, a monk endowed with five qualities does not practice for his own welfare, nor for the welfare of others. Which five? Here, monks, a monk is not accomplished in virtue himself, nor does he encourage others to be accomplished in virtue; he is not accomplished in concentration himself, nor does he encourage others to be accomplished in concentration; he is not accomplished in wisdom himself, nor does he encourage others to be accomplished in wisdom; he is not accomplished in liberation himself, nor does he encourage others to be accomplished in liberation; he is not accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation himself, nor does he encourage others to be accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation. Monks, a monk endowed with these five qualities does not practice for his own welfare, nor for the welfare of others." The ninth.
