## AN 5.173 The Discourse on Hell

173. ‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato upāsako yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ niraye. Katamehi pañcahi? Pāṇātipātī hoti…pe… surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhāyī hoti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato upāsako yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ niraye.

173.“Monks, a lay follower endowed with five qualities is consigned to hell just as if he had been carried there. Which five? He takes life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, engages in false speech, and indulges in intoxicating drinks and drugs that are a basis for heedlessness. Monks, a lay follower endowed with these five qualities is consigned to hell just as if he had been carried there.

‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato upāsako yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ sagge. Katamehi pañcahi? Pāṇātipātā paṭivirato hoti…pe… surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā paṭivirato hoti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato upāsako yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ sagge’’ti. Tatiyaṃ.

“Monks, a lay follower endowed with five qualities is consigned to heaven just as if he had been carried there. Which five? He abstains from taking life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, and abstains from intoxicating drinks and drugs that are a basis for heedlessness. Monks, a lay follower endowed with these five qualities is consigned to heaven just as if he had been carried there.” That is the third.
