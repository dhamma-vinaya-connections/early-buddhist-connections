# AN 5.214 Bahubhāṇisuttaṃ

## AN 5.214 The Discourse on the Talkative Person

214. ‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, ādīnavā bahubhāṇismiṃ puggale. Katame pañca? Musā bhaṇati, pisuṇaṃ bhaṇati, pharusaṃ bhaṇati, samphappalāpaṃ bhaṇati, kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā apāyaṃ duggatiṃ vinipātaṃ nirayaṃ upapajjati. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca ādīnavā bahubhāṇismiṃ puggale.

214."Monks, there are these five drawbacks in a talkative person. Which five? He speaks falsely. He speaks divisively. He speaks harshly. He engages in idle chatter. Upon the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in the lower realms, even in hell. These, monks, are the five drawbacks in a talkative person."

‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, ānisaṃsā mantabhāṇismiṃ puggale. Katame pañca? Na musā bhaṇati, na pisuṇaṃ bhaṇati, na pharusaṃ bhaṇati, na samphappalāpaṃ bhaṇati, kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjati. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca ānisaṃsā mantabhāṇismiṃ puggale’’ti. Catutthaṃ.

"Monks, there are these five benefits for a person who speaks with discernment. Which five? He does not speak falsely, he does not speak divisively, he does not speak harshly, he does not engage in idle chatter, and upon the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. These, monks, are the five benefits for a person who speaks with discernment." (Fourth)
