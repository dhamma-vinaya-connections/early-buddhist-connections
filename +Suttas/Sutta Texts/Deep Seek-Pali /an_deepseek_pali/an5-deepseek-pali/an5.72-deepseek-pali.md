# AN 5.72 Dutiyacetovimuttiphalasuttaṃ

## AN 5.72 The Second Discourse on the Fruit of Liberation of Mind

72. ‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, dhammā bhāvitā bahulīkatā cetovimuttiphalā ca honti cetovimuttiphalānisaṃsā ca, paññāvimuttiphalā ca honti paññāvimuttiphalānisaṃsā ca. Katame pañca? Aniccasaññā, anicce dukkhasaññā, dukkhe anattasaññā, pahānasaññā, virāgasaññā – ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca dhammā bhāvitā bahulīkatā cetovimuttiphalā ca honti cetovimuttiphalānisaṃsā ca, paññāvimuttiphalā ca honti paññāvimuttiphalānisaṃsā ca. Yato kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu cetovimutto ca hoti paññāvimutto ca – ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, ‘bhikkhu ukkhittapaligho itipi, saṃkiṇṇaparikho itipi, abbūḷhesiko itipi, niraggaḷo itipi, ariyo pannaddhajo pannabhāro visaṃyutto itipi’’’.

72."Monks, these five qualities, when developed and cultivated, have deliverance of mind as their fruit and benefit, and have deliverance by wisdom as their fruit and benefit. What five? The perception of impermanence, the perception of suffering in impermanence, the perception of not-self in suffering, the perception of abandoning, the perception of dispassion—these, monks, are the five qualities that, when developed and cultivated, have deliverance of mind as their fruit and benefit, and have deliverance by wisdom as their fruit and benefit. When, monks, a monk is delivered in mind and delivered by wisdom, he is called, monks, ‘a monk who has lifted the crossbar, filled in the moat, uprooted the stake, unbolted the latch; a noble one with banner lowered, burden laid down, unyoked.’"

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ukkhittapaligho hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno avijjā pahīnā hoti ucchinnamūlā tālāvatthukatā anabhāvaṃkatā āyatiṃ anuppādadhammā. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ukkhittapaligho hoti.

"And how, monks, is a monk one who has lifted the crossbar? Here, monks, a monk has abandoned ignorance, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so that it is no more subject to future arising. Thus, monks, a monk is one who has lifted the crossbar."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu saṃkiṇṇaparikho hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno ponobhaviko jātisaṃsāro pahīno hoti ucchinnamūlo tālāvatthukato anabhāvaṃkato āyatiṃ anuppādadhammo. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu saṃkiṇṇaparikho hoti.

"And how, monks, is a monk one with a filled-in moat? Here, monks, a monk has abandoned rebirth and the round of existence, which lead to renewed being. Its root is cut off, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and no more subject to future arising. Thus, monks, a monk is one with a filled-in moat."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu abbūḷhesiko hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno taṇhā pahīnā hoti ucchinnamūlā tālāvatthukatā anabhāvaṃkatā āyatiṃ anuppādadhammā. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu abbūḷhesiko hoti.

"And how, monks, is a monk one whose stake is pulled out? Here, monks, a monk has abandoned craving, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so that it is no more subject to future arising. Thus, monks, a monk is one whose stake is pulled out."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu niraggaḷo hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno pañcorambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni pahīnāni honti ucchinnamūlāni tālāvatthukatāni anabhāvaṃkatāni āyatiṃ anuppādadhammāni. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu niraggaḷo hoti.

"And how, monks, is a monk unfettered? Here, monks, a monk has abandoned the five lower fetters, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they are no more subject to future arising. Thus, monks, a monk is unfettered."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ariyo pannaddhajo pannabhāro visaṃyutto hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno asmimāno pahīno hoti ucchinnamūlo tālāvatthukato anabhāvaṃkato āyatiṃ anuppādadhammo. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ariyo pannaddhajo pannabhāro visaṃyutto hotī’’ti. Dutiyaṃ.

"And how, monks, is a monk a noble one with banner lowered, burden laid down, unyoked? Here, monks, a monk has abandoned the conceit 'I am,' cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so that it is no more subject to future arising. Thus, monks, a monk is a noble one with banner lowered, burden laid down, unyoked."
