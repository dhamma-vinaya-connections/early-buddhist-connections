## AN 5.41 The Adiya Sutta

41. Ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho anāthapiṇḍikaṃ gahapatiṃ bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘pañcime, gahapati, bhogānaṃ ādiyā. Katame pañca? Idha, gahapati, ariyasāvako uṭṭhānavīriyādhigatehi bhogehi bāhābalaparicitehi sedāvakkhittehi dhammikehi dhammaladdhehi attānaṃ sukheti pīṇeti sammā sukhaṃ pariharati; mātāpitaro sukheti pīṇeti sammā sukhaṃ pariharati; puttadāradāsakammakaraporise sukheti pīṇeti sammā sukhaṃ pariharati. Ayaṃ paṭhamo bhogānaṃ ādiyo.

41.At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. Then the householder Anathapindika approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Blessed One said to the householder Anathapindika: "Householder, there are these five benefits of wealth. What five? Here, householder, a noble disciple with wealth acquired by energetic effort, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, rightful and righteously gained, makes himself happy and pleased, and properly maintains his happiness; he makes his mother and father happy and pleased, and properly maintains their happiness; he makes his children, wife, slaves, servants, and workers happy and pleased, and properly maintains their happiness. This is the first benefit of wealth.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, gahapati, ariyasāvako uṭṭhānavīriyādhigatehi bhogehi bāhābalaparicitehi sedāvakkhittehi dhammikehi dhammaladdhehi mittāmacce sukheti pīṇeti sammā sukhaṃ pariharati. Ayaṃ dutiyo bhogānaṃ ādiyo.

"Furthermore, householder, a noble disciple, with wealth acquired by energetic effort, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, rightful and righteously gained, makes his friends and associates happy and pleased, and properly maintains their happiness. This is the second benefit of wealth."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, gahapati, ariyasāvako uṭṭhānavīriyādhigatehi bhogehi bāhābalaparicitehi sedāvakkhittehi dhammikehi dhammaladdhehi yā tā honti āpadā – aggito vā udakato vā rājato vā corato vā appiyato vā dāyādato [appiyato vā dāyādato vā (bahūsu) a. ni. 4.61; 5.148] – tathārūpāsu āpadāsu bhogehi pariyodhāya vattati, sotthiṃ attānaṃ karoti. Ayaṃ tatiyo bhogānaṃ ādiyo.

"Furthermore, householder, a noble disciple, with wealth acquired by energetic effort, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, rightful and righteously gained, uses that wealth to ward off misfortunes—from fire, water, kings, thieves, displeasing persons, or heirs—thereby protecting himself and ensuring his safety. This is the third benefit of wealth."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, gahapati, ariyasāvako uṭṭhānavīriyādhigatehi bhogehi bāhābalaparicitehi sedāvakkhittehi dhammikehi dhammaladdhehi pañcabaliṃ kattā hoti. Ñātibaliṃ, atithibaliṃ, pubbapetabaliṃ, rājabaliṃ, devatābaliṃ – ayaṃ catuttho bhogānaṃ ādiyo.

"Furthermore, householder, a noble disciple, with wealth acquired by energetic effort, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, rightful and righteously gained, makes the five offerings. Offerings to relatives, offerings to guests, offerings to the departed, offerings to the king, offerings to the deities—this is the fourth benefit of wealth."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, gahapati, ariyasāvako uṭṭhānavīriyādhigatehi bhogehi bāhābalaparicitehi sedāvakkhittehi dhammikehi dhammaladdhehi ye te samaṇabrāhmaṇā madappamādā paṭiviratā khantisoracce niviṭṭhā ekamattānaṃ damenti ekamattānaṃ samenti ekamattānaṃ parinibbāpenti, tathārūpesu samaṇabrāhmaṇesu uddhaggikaṃ dakkhiṇaṃ patiṭṭhāpeti sovaggikaṃ sukhavipākaṃ saggasaṃvattanikaṃ. Ayaṃ pañcamo bhogānaṃ ādiyo. Ime kho, gahapati, pañca bhogānaṃ ādiyā.

"Furthermore, householder, a noble disciple, with wealth acquired by energetic effort, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, rightful and righteously gained, establishes an offering of lofty aim for those ascetics and brahmins who are abstaining from intoxication and negligence, devoted to patience and gentleness, each taming himself, each calming himself, each leading himself to Nibbāna. Such an offering is heaven-bound, resulting in happiness, conducive to heaven. This is the fifth benefit of wealth. These, householder, are the five benefits of wealth."

‘‘Tassa ce, gahapati, ariyasāvakassa ime pañca bhogānaṃ ādiye ādiyato bhogā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, tassa evaṃ hoti – ‘ye vata bhogānaṃ ādiyā te cāhaṃ ādiyāmi bhogā ca me parikkhayaṃ gacchantī’ti. Itissa hoti avippaṭisāro. Tassa ce, gahapati, ariyasāvakassa ime pañca bhogānaṃ ādiye ādiyato bhogā abhivaḍḍhanti, tassa evaṃ hoti – ‘ye vata bhogānaṃ ādiyā te cāhaṃ ādiyāmi bhogā ca me abhivaḍḍhantī’ti. Itissa hoti [itissa hoti avippaṭisāro, (sī. syā.)] ubhayeneva avippaṭisāro’’ti.

"If, householder, while a noble disciple uses these five benefits of wealth, his wealth declines, he thinks: 'Indeed, I use these benefits of wealth, and my wealth declines.' Thus he has no remorse. If, householder, while a noble disciple uses these five benefits of wealth, his wealth increases, he thinks: 'Indeed, I use these benefits of wealth, and my wealth increases.' Thus he has no remorse in either case."

‘‘Bhuttā bhogā bhatā bhaccā [gatā tacchā (ka.)], vitiṇṇā āpadāsu me;Uddhaggā dakkhiṇā dinnā, atho pañcabalīkatā;Upaṭṭhitā sīlavanto, saññatā brahmacārayo.

"Wealth has been enjoyed, dependents have been supported, dangers have been overcome, lofty offerings have been given, and the five offerings performed. Virtuous, restrained ones who live the holy life have been attended to by me."

‘‘Yadatthaṃ bhogaṃ iccheyya, paṇḍito gharamāvasaṃ;So me attho anuppatto, kataṃ ananutāpiyaṃ.

"Whatever purpose for wealth a wise householder might wish, that purpose of mine is now attained; I have done what is without regret."

‘‘Etaṃ [evaṃ (ka.)] anussaraṃ macco, ariyadhamme ṭhito naro;Idheva naṃ pasaṃsanti, pecca sagge pamodatī’’ti [pecca sagge ca modatīti (sī. syā.)]. paṭhamaṃ;

"Remembering this, the mortal, a person established in the noble Dhamma, is praised right here, and after death rejoices in heaven." First.
