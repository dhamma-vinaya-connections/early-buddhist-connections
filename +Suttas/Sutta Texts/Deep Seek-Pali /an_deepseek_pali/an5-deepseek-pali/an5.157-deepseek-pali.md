## AN 5.157 The Discourse on Harmful Talk

157. ‘‘Pañcannaṃ, bhikkhave, puggalānaṃ kathā dukkathā puggale puggalaṃ [puggalaṃ puggalaṃ (sī. pī.)] upanidhāya. Katamesaṃ pañcannaṃ? Assaddhassa, bhikkhave, saddhākathā dukkathā; dussīlassa sīlakathā dukkathā; appassutassa bāhusaccakathā dukkathā; maccharissa [macchariyassa (sī. pī. ka.)] cāgakathā dukkathā; duppaññassa paññākathā dukkathā.

157.“Monks, talk is unwelcome for five kinds of individuals with reference to the individual. Which five? For the faithless, monks, talk about faith is unwelcome; for the immoral, talk about virtue is unwelcome; for the unlearned, talk about extensive learning is unwelcome; for the stingy, talk about generosity is unwelcome; for the unwise, talk about wisdom is unwelcome.

‘‘Kasmā ca, bhikkhave, assaddhassa saddhākathā dukkathā? Assaddho, bhikkhave, saddhākathāya kacchamānāya abhisajjati kuppati byāpajjati patitthīyati kopañca dosañca appaccayañca pātukaroti. Taṃ kissa hetu? Tañhi so, bhikkhave, saddhāsampadaṃ attani na samanupassati [na sampassati (sī.)], na ca labhati tatonidānaṃ pītipāmojjaṃ. Tasmā assaddhassa saddhākathā dukkathā.

“And why, monks, is talk about faith unwelcome to one without faith? When talk about faith is being discussed, the faithless person becomes annoyed, angry, hostile, and resistant; he displays annoyance, anger, and discontent. Why is that? Because, monks, he does not see within himself the accomplishment of faith, nor does he obtain joy and gladness arising from it. Therefore, talk about faith is unwelcome to one without faith.”

‘‘Kasmā ca, bhikkhave, dussīlassa sīlakathā dukkathā? Dussīlo, bhikkhave, sīlakathāya kacchamānāya abhisajjati kuppati byāpajjati patitthīyati kopañca dosañca appaccayañca pātukaroti. Taṃ kissa hetu? Tañhi so, bhikkhave, sīlasampadaṃ attani na samanupassati na ca labhati tatonidānaṃ pītipāmojjaṃ. Tasmā dussīlassa sīlakathā dukkathā.

“And why, monks, is talk about virtue unwelcome to one without virtue? When talk about virtue is being discussed, the immoral person becomes annoyed, angry, hostile, and resistant; he displays annoyance, anger, and discontent. Why is that? Because, monks, he does not see within himself the accomplishment of virtue, nor does he obtain joy and gladness arising from it. Therefore, talk about virtue is unwelcome to one without virtue.”

‘‘Kasmā ca, bhikkhave, appassutassa bāhusaccakathā dukkathā? Appassuto, bhikkhave, bāhusaccakathāya kacchamānāya abhisajjati kuppati byāpajjati patitthīyati kopañca dosañca appaccayañca pātukaroti. Taṃ kissa hetu? Tañhi so, bhikkhave, sutasampadaṃ attani na samanupassati, na ca labhati tatonidānaṃ pītipāmojjaṃ. Tasmā appassutassa bāhusaccakathā dukkathā.

“And why, monks, is talk about extensive learning unwelcome to one with little learning? When talk about extensive learning is being discussed, the unlearned person becomes annoyed, angry, hostile, and resistant; he displays annoyance, anger, and discontent. Why is that? Because, monks, he does not see within himself the accomplishment of learning, nor does he obtain joy and gladness arising from it. Therefore, talk about extensive learning is unwelcome to one with little learning.

‘‘Kasmā ca, bhikkhave, maccharissa cāgakathā dukkathā? Maccharī, bhikkhave, cāgakathāya kacchamānāya abhisajjati kuppati byāpajjati patitthīyati kopañca dosañca appaccayañca pātukaroti. Taṃ kissa hetu? Tañhi so, bhikkhave, cāgasampadaṃ attani na samanupassati na ca labhati tatonidānaṃ pītipāmojjaṃ. Tasmā maccharissa cāgakathā dukkathā.

“And why, monks, is talk about generosity unwelcome to the stingy? When talk about generosity is being discussed, the stingy person becomes annoyed, angry, hostile, and resistant; he displays annoyance, anger, and discontent. Why is that? Because, monks, he does not see within himself the accomplishment of generosity, nor does he obtain joy and gladness arising from it. Therefore, talk about generosity is unwelcome to the stingy.”

‘‘Kasmā ca, bhikkhave, duppaññassa paññākathā dukkathā? Duppañño, bhikkhave, paññākathāya kacchamānāya abhisajjati kuppati byāpajjati patitthīyati kopañca dosañca appaccayañca pātukaroti. Taṃ kissa hetu? Tañhi so, bhikkhave, paññāsampadaṃ attani na samanupassati, na ca labhati tatonidānaṃ pītipāmojjaṃ. Tasmā duppaññassa paññākathā dukkathā. Imesaṃ kho, bhikkhave, pañcannaṃ puggalānaṃ kathā dukkathā puggale puggalaṃ upanidhāya.

“And why, monks, is talk about wisdom unwelcome to the unwise? When talk about wisdom is being discussed, the unwise person becomes annoyed, angry, hostile, and resistant; he displays annoyance, anger, and discontent. Why is that? Because, monks, he does not see within himself the accomplishment of wisdom, nor does he obtain joy and gladness arising from it. Therefore, talk about wisdom is unwelcome to the unwise. For these five kinds of individuals, monks, talk is unwelcome with reference to the individual.”

‘‘Pañcannaṃ, bhikkhave, puggalānaṃ kathā sukathā puggale puggalaṃ upanidhāya. Katamesaṃ pañcannaṃ? Saddhassa, bhikkhave, saddhākathā sukathā; sīlavato sīlakathā sukathā; bahussutassa bāhusaccakathā sukathā; cāgavato cāgakathā sukathā; paññavato paññākathā sukathā.

Taṃ kissa hetu? Tañhi so, bhikkhave, saddhāsampadaṃ attani samanupassati labhati ca tatonidānaṃ pītipāmojjaṃ. Tasmā saddhassa saddhākathā sukathā.

“And why, monks, is talk about faith well-spoken for one with faith?
