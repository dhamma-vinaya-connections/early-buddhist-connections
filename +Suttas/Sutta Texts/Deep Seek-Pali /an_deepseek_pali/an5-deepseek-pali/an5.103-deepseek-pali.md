## AN 5.103 The Discourse on the Great Thief

103. ‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, aṅgehi samannāgato mahācoro sandhimpi chindati, nillopampi harati, ekāgārikampi karoti, paripanthepi tiṭṭhati. Katamehi pañcahi? Idha, bhikkhave, mahācoro visamanissito ca hoti, gahananissito ca, balavanissito ca, bhogacāgī ca, ekacārī ca.

103."Bhikkhus, a great thief endowed with five factors breaks into houses, plunders wealth, ransacks single houses, and lies in wait on highways. What are the five? Here, bhikkhus, a great thief relies on uneven ground, relies on thickets, relies on powerful people, is generous with his gains, and acts alone."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, mahācoro visamanissito hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, mahācoro nadīviduggaṃ vā nissito hoti pabbatavisamaṃ vā. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, mahācoro visamanissito hoti.

"And how, bhikkhus, does a great thief rely on thickets? Here, bhikkhus, a great thief relies on a thicket of grass, a thicket of trees, a thicket of bushes, or a dense forest. Thus, bhikkhus, does a great thief rely on thickets."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, mahācoro balavanissito hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, mahācoro rājānaṃ vā rājamahāmattānaṃ vā nissito hoti. Tassa evaṃ hoti – ‘sace maṃ koci kiñci vakkhati, ime me rājāno vā rājamahāmattā vā pariyodhāya atthaṃ bhaṇissantī’ti. Sace naṃ koci kiñci āha, tyassa rājāno vā rājamahāmattā vā pariyodhāya atthaṃ bhaṇanti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, mahācoro balavanissito hoti.

"And how, bhikkhus, does a great thief rely on powerful people? Here, bhikkhus, a great thief relies on a king or royal ministers. He thinks: 'If anyone says anything to me, these kings or royal ministers will take my side and speak in my favor.'

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, mahācoro bhogacāgī hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, mahācoro aḍḍho hoti mahaddhano mahābhogo. Tassa evaṃ hoti – ‘sace maṃ koci kiñci vakkhati, ito bhogena paṭisantharissāmī’ti. Sace naṃ koci kiñci āha, tato bhogena paṭisantharati. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, mahācoro bhogacāgī hoti.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, mahācoro ekacārī hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, mahācoro ekakova gahaṇāni [niggahaṇāni (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] kattā hoti. Taṃ kissa hetu? ‘Mā me guyhamantā bahiddhā sambhedaṃ agamaṃsū’ti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, mahācoro ekacārī hoti.

"And how, bhikkhus, does a great thief act alone? Here, bhikkhus, a great thief commits robberies alone. Why is that? 'So that my secret plans may not spread abroad.' Thus, bhikkhus, does a great thief act alone."

‘‘Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahaṅgehi samannāgato mahācoro sandhimpi chindati nillopampi harati ekāgārikampi karoti paripanthepi tiṭṭhati.
