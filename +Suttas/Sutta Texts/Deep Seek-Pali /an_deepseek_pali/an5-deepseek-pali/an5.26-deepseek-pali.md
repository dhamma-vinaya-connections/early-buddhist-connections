## AN 5.26 The Discourse on the Bases for Liberation

26. ‘‘Pañcimāni, bhikkhave, vimuttāyatanāni yattha bhikkhuno appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato avimuttaṃ vā cittaṃ vimuccati, aparikkhīṇā vā āsavā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, ananuppattaṃ vā anuttaraṃ yogakkhemaṃ anupāpuṇāti.

26."Bhikkhus, there are these five bases for liberation where, for a bhikkhu dwelling heedful, ardent, and resolute, the unliberated mind becomes liberated, the unexhausted taints go to their destruction, or the unattained supreme security from bondage is attained."

‘‘Katamāni pañca? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno satthā dhammaṃ deseti aññataro vā garuṭṭhāniyo sabrahmacārī. Yathā yathā, bhikkhave, tassa bhikkhuno satthā dhammaṃ deseti, aññataro vā garuṭṭhāniyo sabrahmacārī, tathā tathā so tasmiṃ dhamme atthapaṭisaṃvedī ca hoti dhammapaṭisaṃvedī ca. Tassa atthapaṭisaṃvedino dhammapaṭisaṃvedino pāmojjaṃ [pāmujjaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ.) dī. ni. 3.322] jāyati. Pamuditassa pīti jāyati. Pītimanassa kāyo passambhati. Passaddhakāyo sukhaṃ vedeti [vediyati (sī.)]. Sukhino cittaṃ samādhiyati. Idaṃ, bhikkhave, paṭhamaṃ vimuttāyatanaṃ yattha bhikkhuno appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato avimuttaṃ vā cittaṃ vimuccati, aparikkhīṇā vā āsavā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, ananuppattaṃ vā anuttaraṃ yogakkhemaṃ anupāpuṇāti.

"What five? Here, bhikkhus, the Teacher or another venerable fellow practitioner teaches the Dhamma to a bhikkhu. As the Teacher or another venerable fellow practitioner teaches the Dhamma to that bhikkhu, so he experiences the meaning and the Dhamma in that Dhamma. For one experiencing the meaning and the Dhamma, joy arises. For one who is joyful, rapture arises. For one whose mind is enraptured, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body experiences happiness. For one who is happy, the mind becomes concentrated. This, bhikkhus, is the first basis for liberation where, for a bhikkhu dwelling heedful, ardent, and resolute, the unliberated mind becomes liberated, the unexhausted taints go to their destruction, or the unattained supreme security from bondage is attained."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno na heva kho satthā dhammaṃ deseti, aññataro vā garuṭṭhāniyo sabrahmacārī, api ca kho yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ vitthārena paresaṃ deseti. Yathā yathā, bhikkhave, bhikkhu yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ vitthārena paresaṃ deseti tathā tathā so tasmiṃ dhamme atthapaṭisaṃvedī ca hoti dhammapaṭisaṃvedī ca. Tassa atthapaṭisaṃvedino dhammapaṭisaṃvedino pāmojjaṃ jāyati. Pamuditassa pīti jāyati. Pītimanassa kāyo passambhati. Passaddhakāyo sukhaṃ vedeti. Sukhino cittaṃ samādhiyati. Idaṃ, bhikkhave, dutiyaṃ vimuttāyatanaṃ yattha bhikkhuno appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato avimuttaṃ vā cittaṃ vimuccati, aparikkhīṇā vā āsavā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, ananuppattaṃ vā anuttaraṃ yogakkhemaṃ anupāpuṇāti.

"Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu may not have the Teacher expound the Dhamma to him, nor another venerable fellow practitioner, but he teaches the Dhamma in detail to others as he has heard and learned it. As that bhikkhu teaches the Dhamma in detail to others as he has heard and learned it, so he experiences the meaning and the Dhamma in that Dhamma. For one experiencing the meaning and the Dhamma, joy arises. For one who is joyful, rapture arises. For one whose mind is enraptured, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body experiences happiness. For one who is happy, the mind becomes concentrated. This, bhikkhus, is the second basis for liberation where, for a bhikkhu dwelling heedful, ardent, and resolute, the unliberated mind becomes liberated, the unexhausted taints go to their destruction, or the unattained supreme security from bondage is attained."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno na heva kho satthā dhammaṃ deseti, aññataro vā garuṭṭhāniyo sabrahmacārī, nāpi yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ vitthārena paresaṃ deseti, api ca kho yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ vitthārena sajjhāyaṃ karoti. Yathā yathā, bhikkhave, bhikkhu yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ vitthārena sajjhāyaṃ karoti tathā tathā so tasmiṃ dhamme atthapaṭisaṃvedī ca hoti dhammapaṭisaṃvedī ca. Tassa atthapaṭisaṃvedino dhammapaṭisaṃvedino pāmojjaṃ jāyati. Pamuditassa pīti jāyati. Pītimanassa kāyo passambhati. Passaddhakāyo sukhaṃ vedeti. Sukhino cittaṃ samādhiyati. Idaṃ, bhikkhave, tatiyaṃ vimuttāyatanaṃ yattha bhikkhuno appamattassa ātāpino…pe… yogakkhemaṃ anupāpuṇāti.

"Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu may not have the Teacher expound the Dhamma to him, nor another venerable fellow practitioner, nor does he teach the Dhamma in detail to others as he has heard and learned it, but he recites the Dhamma in detail as he has heard and learned it. As that bhikkhu recites the Dhamma in detail as he has heard and learned it, so he experiences the meaning and the Dhamma in that Dhamma. For one experiencing the meaning and the Dhamma, joy arises. For one who is joyful, rapture arises. For one whose mind is enraptured, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body experiences happiness. For one who is happy, the mind becomes concentrated. This, bhikkhus, is the third basis for liberation where, for a bhikkhu dwelling heedful, ardent, and resolute, the unliberated mind becomes liberated, the unexhausted taints go to their destruction, or the unattained supreme security from bondage is attained."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno na heva kho satthā dhammaṃ deseti, aññataro vā garuṭṭhāniyo sabrahmacārī, nāpi yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ vitthārena paresaṃ deseti, nāpi yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ vitthārena sajjhāyaṃ karoti; api ca kho yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ cetasā anuvitakketi anuvicāreti manasānupekkhati. Yathā yathā, bhikkhave, bhikkhu yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ cetasā anuvitakketi anuvicāreti manasānupekkhati tathā tathā so tasmiṃ dhamme atthapaṭisaṃvedī ca hoti dhammapaṭisaṃvedī ca. Tassa atthapaṭisaṃvedino dhammapaṭisaṃvedino pāmojjaṃ jāyati. Pamuditassa pīti jāyati. Pītimanassa kāyo passambhati. Passaddhakāyo sukhaṃ vedeti. Sukhino cittaṃ samādhiyati. Idaṃ, bhikkhave, catutthaṃ vimuttāyatanaṃ yattha bhikkhuno appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato avimuttaṃ vā cittaṃ vimuccati, aparikkhīṇā vā āsavā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, ananuppattaṃ vā anuttaraṃ yogakkhemaṃ anupāpuṇāti.

"Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu may not have the Teacher expound the Dhamma to him, nor another venerable fellow practitioner, nor does he teach the Dhamma in detail to others as he has heard and learned it, nor does he recite the Dhamma in detail as he has heard and learned it; but he mentally thinks about, considers, and examines the Dhamma as he has heard and learned it. As that bhikkhu mentally thinks about, considers, and examines the Dhamma as he has heard and learned it, so he experiences the meaning and the Dhamma in that Dhamma. For one experiencing the meaning and the Dhamma, joy arises. For one who is joyful, rapture arises. For one whose mind is enraptured, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body experiences happiness. For one who is happy, the mind becomes concentrated. This, bhikkhus, is the fourth basis for liberation where, for a bhikkhu dwelling heedful, ardent, and resolute, the unliberated mind becomes liberated, the unexhausted taints go to their destruction, or the unattained supreme security from bondage is attained."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno na heva kho satthā dhammaṃ deseti aññataro vā garuṭṭhāniyo sabrahmacārī, nāpi yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ vitthārena paresaṃ deseti, nāpi yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ vitthārena sajjhāyaṃ karoti, nāpi yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ cetasā anuvitakketi anuvicāreti manasānupekkhati; api ca khvassa aññataraṃ samādhinimittaṃ suggahitaṃ hoti sumanasikataṃ sūpadhāritaṃ suppaṭividdhaṃ paññāya. Yathā yathā, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno aññataraṃ samādhinimittaṃ suggahitaṃ hoti sumanasikataṃ sūpadhāritaṃ suppaṭividdhaṃ paññāya tathā tathā so tasmiṃ dhamme atthapaṭisaṃvedī ca hoti dhammapaṭisaṃvedī ca. Tassa atthapaṭisaṃvedino dhammapaṭisaṃvedino pāmojjaṃ jāyati. Pamuditassa pīti jāyati. Pītimanassa kāyo passambhati. Passaddhakāyo sukhaṃ vedeti. Sukhino cittaṃ samādhiyati. Idaṃ, bhikkhave, pañcamaṃ vimuttāyatanaṃ yattha bhikkhuno appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato avimuttaṃ vā cittaṃ vimuccati, aparikkhīṇā vā āsavā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, ananuppattaṃ vā anuttaraṃ yogakkhemaṃ anupāpuṇāti.

"Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu may not have the Teacher expound the Dhamma to him, nor another venerable fellow practitioner, nor does he teach the Dhamma in detail to others as he has heard and learned it, nor does he recite the Dhamma in detail as he has heard and learned it, nor does he mentally think about, consider, and examine the Dhamma as he has heard and learned it; but a certain object of concentration is properly grasped, well-attended to, well-pondered, and well-penetrated by wisdom for him. As a certain object of concentration is properly grasped, well-attended to, well-pondered, and well-penetrated by wisdom for that bhikkhu, so he experiences the meaning and the Dhamma in that Dhamma. For one experiencing the meaning and the Dhamma, joy arises. For one who is joyful, rapture arises. For one whose mind is enraptured, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body experiences happiness. For one who is happy, the mind becomes concentrated. This, bhikkhus, is the fifth basis for liberation where, for a bhikkhu dwelling heedful, ardent, and resolute, the unliberated mind becomes liberated, the unexhausted taints go to their destruction, or the unattained supreme security from bondage is attained."

‘‘Imāni kho, bhikkhave, pañca vimuttāyatanāni yattha bhikkhuno appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato avimuttaṃ vā cittaṃ vimuccati, aparikkhīṇā vā āsavā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, ananuppattaṃ vā anuttaraṃ yogakkhemaṃ anupāpuṇātī’’ti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

"Bhikkhus, these are the five bases for liberation where, for a bhikkhu dwelling heedful, ardent, and resolute, the unliberated mind becomes liberated, the unexhausted taints go to their destruction, or the unattained supreme security from bondage is attained." The sixth.
