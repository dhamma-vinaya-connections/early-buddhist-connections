# AN 5.250 Puggalappasādasuttaṃ

## AN 5.250 The Discourse on Confidence in Individuals

250. ‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, ādīnavā puggalappasāde. Katame pañca? Yasmiṃ, bhikkhave, puggale puggalo abhippasanno hoti, so tathārūpaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno hoti yathārūpāya āpattiyā saṅgho ukkhipati. Tassa evaṃ hoti – ‘yo kho myāyaṃ puggalo piyo manāpo so saṅghena ukkhitto’ti. Bhikkhūsu appasādabahulo hoti. Bhikkhūsu appasādabahulo samāno aññe bhikkhū na bhajati. Aññe bhikkhū abhajanto saddhammaṃ na suṇāti. Saddhammaṃ asuṇanto saddhammā parihāyati. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, paṭhamo ādīnavo puggalappasāde.

250.“Bhikkhus, there are these five drawbacks in confidence in individuals. What five? When a bhikkhu has confidence in an individual, and that individual commits such an offense that the Saṅgha suspends him, he thinks: ‘This individual, who is dear and agreeable to me, has been suspended by the Saṅgha.’ He becomes full of displeasure towards the bhikkhus. Being full of displeasure towards the bhikkhus, he does not associate with other bhikkhus. Not associating with other bhikkhus, he does not hear the true Dhamma. Not hearing the true Dhamma, he declines from the true Dhamma. This, bhikkhus, is the first drawback in confidence in individuals.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, yasmiṃ puggale puggalo abhippasanno hoti, so tathārūpaṃ āpattiṃ āpanno hoti yathārūpāya āpattiyā saṅgho ante nisīdāpeti. Tassa evaṃ hoti – ‘yo kho myāyaṃ puggalo piyo manāpo so saṅghena ante nisīdāpito’ti. Bhikkhūsu appasādabahulo hoti. Bhikkhūsu appasādabahulo samāno aññe bhikkhū na bhajati. Aññe bhikkhū abhajanto saddhammaṃ na suṇāti. Saddhammaṃ asuṇanto saddhammā parihāyati. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, dutiyo ādīnavo puggalappasāde.

“Furthermore, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu has confidence in an individual, and that individual commits such an offense that the Saṅgha makes him sit at the end, he thinks: ‘This individual, who is dear and agreeable to me, has been made to sit at the end by the Saṅgha.’ He becomes full of displeasure towards the bhikkhus. Being full of displeasure towards the bhikkhus, he does not associate with other bhikkhus. Not associating with other bhikkhus, he does not hear the true Dhamma. Not hearing the true Dhamma, he declines from the true Dhamma. This, bhikkhus, is the second drawback in confidence in individuals.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, yasmiṃ puggale puggalo abhippasanno hoti, so disāpakkanto hoti…pe… so vibbhanto hoti…pe… so kālaṅkato hoti. Tassa evaṃ hoti – ‘yo kho myāyaṃ puggalo piyo manāpo so kālaṅkato’ti. Aññe bhikkhū na bhajati. Aññe bhikkhū abhajanto saddhammaṃ na suṇāti. Saddhammaṃ asuṇanto saddhammā parihāyati. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, pañcamo ādīnavo puggalappasāde. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca ādīnavā puggalappasāde’’ti. Dasamaṃ.

“Furthermore, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu has confidence in an individual, and that individual has gone to a distant place…or has gone astray…or has died. He thinks: ‘This individual, who is dear and agreeable to me, has died.’ He does not associate with other bhikkhus. Not associating with other bhikkhus, he does not hear the true Dhamma. Not hearing the true Dhamma, he declines from the true Dhamma. This, bhikkhus, is the fifth drawback in confidence in individuals. These, bhikkhus, are the five drawbacks in confidence in individuals.” The tenth.
