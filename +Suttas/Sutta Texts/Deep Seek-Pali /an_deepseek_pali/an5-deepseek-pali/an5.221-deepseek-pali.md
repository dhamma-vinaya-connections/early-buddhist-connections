# AN 5.221 Paṭhamadīghacārikasuttaṃ

## AN 5.221 The First Discourse on Long Wandering

221. ‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, ādīnavā dīghacārikaṃ anavatthacārikaṃ anuyuttassa viharato. Katame pañca? Assutaṃ na suṇāti, sutaṃ na pariyodāpeti, sutenekaccena avisārado hoti, gāḷhaṃ [bāḷhaṃ (syā.)] rogātaṅkaṃ phusati, na ca mittavā hoti. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca ādīnavā dīghacārikaṃ anavatthacārikaṃ anuyuttassa viharato.

221."Monks, there are these five drawbacks for one who lives addicted to long and unsettled wandering. What five? He does not hear what he has not heard. He does not master what he has heard. He is not confident in some of what he has heard. He is afflicted by a severe disease. And he is not friendly. These, monks, are the five drawbacks for one who lives addicted to long and unsettled wandering.

‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, ānisaṃsā samavatthacāre. Katame pañca? Assutaṃ suṇāti, sutaṃ pariyodāpeti, sutenekaccena visārado hoti, na gāḷhaṃ rogātaṅkaṃ phusati, mittavā ca hoti. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca ānisaṃsā samavatthacāre’’ti. Paṭhamaṃ.

"Monks, there are these five benefits of settled conduct. What five? One hears what one has not heard before, one masters what one has heard, one becomes confident in some of what one has heard, one is not afflicted by severe illness, and one is friendly. These, monks, are the five benefits of settled conduct." First.
