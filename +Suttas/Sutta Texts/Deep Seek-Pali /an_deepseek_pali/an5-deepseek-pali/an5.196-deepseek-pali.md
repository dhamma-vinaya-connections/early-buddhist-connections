## AN 5.196 The Great Dreams Discourse

196. ‘‘Tathāgatassa, bhikkhave, arahato sammāsambuddhassa pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato pañca mahāsupinā pāturahesuṃ. Katame pañca? Tathāgatassa, bhikkhave, arahato sammāsambuddhassa pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato ayaṃ mahāpathavī mahāsayanaṃ ahosi, himavā pabbatarājā bibbohanaṃ [bibbohanaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.), bimba + ohanaṃ = iti padavibhāgo] ahosi, puratthime samudde vāmo hattho ohito ahosi, pacchime samudde dakkhiṇo hattho ohito ahosi, dakkhiṇe samudde ubho pādā ohitā ahesuṃ. Tathāgatassa, bhikkhave, arahato sammāsambuddhassa pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato ayaṃ paṭhamo mahāsupino pāturahosi.

196.Monks, before the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, had attained complete enlightenment, while he was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta, five great dreams appeared. What five? Monks, before the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, had attained complete enlightenment, while he was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta, this great earth became his couch, the Himalayas, the king of mountains, became his pillow, his left hand rested in the eastern ocean, his right hand rested in the western ocean, and both his feet rested in the southern ocean. Monks, this was the first great dream that appeared to the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, before he had attained complete enlightenment, while he was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, tathāgatassa arahato sammāsambuddhassa pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato tiriyā nāma tiṇajāti nābhiyā uggantvā nabhaṃ āhacca ṭhitā ahosi. Tathāgatassa, bhikkhave, arahato sammāsambuddhassa pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato ayaṃ dutiyo mahāsupino pāturahosi.

Furthermore, monks, before the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, had attained complete enlightenment, while he was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta, a grass plant named tiriyā sprouted from his navel and stood reaching up to the sky. Monks, this was the second great dream that appeared to the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, before he had attained complete enlightenment, while he was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, tathāgatassa arahato sammāsambuddhassa pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato setā kimī kaṇhasīsā pādehi ussakkitvā ( ) [(agganakhato) katthaci dissati] yāva jāṇumaṇḍalā paṭicchādesuṃ. Tathāgatassa, bhikkhave, arahato sammāsambuddhassa pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato ayaṃ tatiyo mahāsupino pāturahosi.

Furthermore, monks, before the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, had attained complete enlightenment, while he was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta, white worms with black heads crawled up from his feet and covered him up to the knees. Monks, this was the third great dream that appeared to the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, before he had attained complete enlightenment, while he was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, tathāgatassa arahato sammāsambuddhassa pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato cattāro sakuṇā nānāvaṇṇā catūhi disāhi āgantvā pādamūle nipatitvā sabbasetā sampajjiṃsu. Tathāgatassa, bhikkhave, arahato sammāsambuddhassa pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato ayaṃ catuttho mahāsupino pāturahosi.

Furthermore, monks, before the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, had attained complete enlightenment, while he was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta, four birds of different colors came from the four directions, fell at his feet, and became entirely white. Monks, this was the fourth great dream that appeared to the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, before he had attained complete enlightenment, while he was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, tathāgato arahaṃ sammāsambuddho pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddho bodhisattova samāno mahato mīḷhapabbatassa uparūpari caṅkamati alippamāno mīḷhena. Tathāgatassa, bhikkhave, arahato sammāsambuddhassa pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato ayaṃ pañcamo mahāsupino pāturahosi.

Furthermore, monks, before the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, had attained complete enlightenment, while he was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta, he walked back and forth on the top of a great heap of excrement without being smeared by the excrement. Monks, this was the fifth great dream that appeared to the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, before he had attained complete enlightenment, while he was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta.

‘‘Yampi, bhikkhave, tathāgatassa arahato sammāsambuddhassa pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato ayaṃ mahāpathavī mahāsayanaṃ ahosi, himavā pabbatarājā bibbohanaṃ ahosi, puratthime samudde vāmo hattho ohito ahosi, pacchime samudde dakkhiṇo hattho ohito ahosi, dakkhiṇe samudde ubho pādā ohitā ahesuṃ; tathāgatena, bhikkhave, arahatā sammāsambuddhena anuttarā sammāsambodhi abhisambuddhā. Tassā abhisambodhāya ayaṃ paṭhamo mahāsupino pāturahosi.

Monks, that for the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, before his Awakening, while he was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta, this great earth was a great bed, the Himalaya, the king of mountains, was a pillow, his left hand rested in the eastern ocean, his right hand rested in the western ocean, and both his feet rested in the southern ocean—this signifies that the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, has awakened to the unsurpassed perfect Awakening. For that Awakening, this first great dream appeared.

‘‘Yampi, bhikkhave, tathāgatassa arahato sammāsambuddhassa pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato tiriyā nāma tiṇajāti nābhiyā uggantvā nabhaṃ āhacca ṭhitā ahosi; tathāgatena, bhikkhave, arahatā sammāsambuddhena ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo abhisambujjhitvā yāva devamanussehi suppakāsito. Tassa abhisambodhāya ayaṃ dutiyo mahāsupino pāturahosi.

Monks, that for the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, before his Awakening, while he was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta, a grass plant named tiriyā sprouted from his navel and stood reaching up to the sky—this signifies that the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, having fully awakened to the Noble Eightfold Path, has proclaimed it well among gods and humans. For that Awakening, this second great dream appeared.

‘‘Yampi, bhikkhave, tathāgatassa arahato sammāsambuddhassa pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato setā kimī kaṇhasīsā pādehi ussakkitvā yāva jāṇumaṇḍalā paṭicchādesuṃ; bahū, bhikkhave, gihī odātavasanā tathāgataṃ pāṇupetā [pāṇupetaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] saraṇaṃ gatā. Tassa abhisambodhāya ayaṃ tatiyo mahāsupino pāturahosi.

Monks, that for the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, before his Awakening, while he was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta, white worms with black heads crawled up from his feet and covered him up to his knees—this signifies that many householders, clad in white, have gone for refuge to the Tathagata for life. For that Awakening, this third great dream appeared.

‘‘Yampi, bhikkhave, tathāgatassa arahato sammāsambuddhassa pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato cattāro sakuṇā nānāvaṇṇā catūhi disāhi āgantvā pādamūle nipatitvā sabbasetā sampajjiṃsu; cattārome, bhikkhave, vaṇṇā khattiyā brāhmaṇā vessā suddā te tathāgatappavedite dhammavinaye agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajitvā anuttaraṃ vimuttiṃ sacchikaronti. Tassa abhisambodhāya ayaṃ catuttho mahāsupino pāturahosi.

Monks, that for the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, before his Awakening, while he was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta, four birds of various colors came from the four directions, fell at his feet, and became completely white—this signifies that these four social classes—khattiyas, brahmins, vessas, and suddas—having gone forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma-Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathagata, realize unsurpassed liberation. For that Awakening, this fourth great dream appeared.

‘‘Yampi, bhikkhave, tathāgato arahaṃ sammāsambuddho pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddho bodhisattova samāno mahato mīḷhapabbatassa uparūpari caṅkamati alippamāno mīḷhena; lābhī, bhikkhave, tathāgato cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhārānaṃ, taṃ [tattha ca (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] tathāgato agathito [agadhito (syā. pī. ka.)] amucchito anajjhosanno [anajjhāpanno (ka.) anajjhopanno (sī. syā.)] ādīnavadassāvī nissaraṇapañño paribhuñjati. Tassa abhisambodhāya ayaṃ pañcamo mahāsupino pāturahosi.

Monks, that for the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, before his Awakening, while he was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta, he walked back and forth on top of a great heap of excrement without being soiled by the excrement—this signifies that the Tathagata gains robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites, but he is not attached, infatuated, or addicted to them; seeing the danger in them and understanding the escape from them, he makes use of them. For that Awakening, this fifth great dream appeared.

‘‘Tathāgatassa, bhikkhave, arahato sammāsambuddhassa pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato ime pañca mahāsupinā pāturahesu’’nti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

Bhikkhus, these five great dreams appeared to the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, before his enlightenment, while he was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta.
