## AN 5.238 The Third Discourse on Those Deserving Dispraise

238. ‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato āvāsiko bhikkhu yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ niraye. Katamehi pañcahi? Ananuvicca apariyogāhetvā avaṇṇārahassa vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati; ananuvicca apariyogāhetvā vaṇṇārahassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati; āvāsamaccharī hoti; kulamaccharī hoti; lābhamaccharī hoti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato āvāsiko bhikkhu yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ niraye.

238."Monks, a resident monk endowed with five qualities is consigned to hell as if brought there. What five? Without having investigated or examined thoroughly, he speaks praise of one who deserves dispraise; without having investigated or examined thoroughly, he speaks dispraise of one who deserves praise; he is stingy about his dwelling; he is stingy about families; and he is stingy about gains. A resident monk endowed with these five qualities, monks, is consigned to hell as if brought there."

‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato āvāsiko bhikkhu yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ sagge. Katamehi pañcahi? Anuvicca pariyogāhetvā avaṇṇārahassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati; anuvicca pariyogāhetvā vaṇṇārahassa vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati; na āvāsamaccharī hoti; na kulamaccharī hoti; na lābhamaccharī hoti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato āvāsiko bhikkhu yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ sagge’’ti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

"Monks, a resident monk endowed with five qualities is consigned to heaven as if brought there. What five? Having investigated or examined thoroughly, he speaks dispraise of one who deserves dispraise; having investigated or examined thoroughly, he speaks praise of one who deserves praise; he is not stingy about his dwelling; he is not stingy about families; and he is not stingy about gains. A resident monk endowed with these five qualities, monks, is consigned to heaven as if brought there." This is the eighth.
