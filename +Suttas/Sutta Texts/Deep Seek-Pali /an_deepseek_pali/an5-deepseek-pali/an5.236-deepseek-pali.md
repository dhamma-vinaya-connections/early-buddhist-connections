## AN 5.236 The First Discourse on Those Deserving Dispraise

236. ‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato āvāsiko bhikkhu yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ niraye. Katamehi pañcahi? Ananuvicca apariyogāhetvā avaṇṇārahassa vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati; ananuvicca apariyogāhetvā vaṇṇārahassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati; ananuvicca apariyogāhetvā appasādanīye ṭhāne pasādaṃ upadaṃseti; ananuvicca apariyogāhetvā pasādanīye ṭhāne appasādaṃ upadaṃseti; saddhādeyyaṃ vinipāteti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato āvāsiko bhikkhu yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ niraye.

236."Monks, a resident monk endowed with five qualities is consigned to hell as if brought there. What five? Without having investigated or examined thoroughly, he speaks praise of one who deserves dispraise; without having investigated or examined thoroughly, he speaks dispraise of one who deserves praise; without having investigated or examined thoroughly, he arouses confidence in what is not arousing of confidence; without having investigated or examined thoroughly, he arouses lack of confidence in what is arousing of confidence; and he destroys offerings given in faith. A resident monk endowed with these five qualities, monks, is consigned to hell as if brought there."

‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato āvāsiko bhikkhu yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ sagge. Katamehi pañcahi? Anuvicca pariyogāhetvā avaṇṇārahassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati; anuvicca pariyogāhetvā vaṇṇārahassa vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati; anuvicca pariyogāhetvā appasādanīye ṭhāne appasādaṃ upadaṃseti; anuvicca pariyogāhetvā pasādanīye ṭhāne pasādaṃ upadaṃseti; saddhādeyyaṃ na vinipāteti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato āvāsiko bhikkhu yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ sagge’’ti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

"Monks, a resident monk endowed with five qualities is consigned to heaven as if brought there. What five? Having investigated or examined thoroughly, he speaks dispraise of one who deserves dispraise; having investigated or examined thoroughly, he speaks praise of one who deserves praise; having investigated or examined thoroughly, he arouses lack of confidence in what is not arousing of confidence; having investigated or examined thoroughly, he arouses confidence in what is arousing of confidence; and he does not destroy offerings given in faith. A resident monk endowed with these five qualities, monks, is consigned to heaven as if brought there." This is the sixth.
