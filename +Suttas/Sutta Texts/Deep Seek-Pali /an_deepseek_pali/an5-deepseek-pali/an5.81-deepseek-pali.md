Monks, an elder monk endowed with these five qualities is disliked, disagreeable, unrespected, and unesteemed by his fellow monks."

‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato thero bhikkhu sabrahmacārīnaṃ piyo ca hoti manāpo ca garu ca bhāvanīyo ca. Katamehi pañcahi? Rajanīye na rajjati, dussanīye na dussati, mohanīye na muyhati, kuppanīye na kuppati, madanīye na majjati – imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato thero bhikkhu sabrahmacārīnaṃ piyo ca hoti manāpo ca garu ca bhāvanīyo cā’’ti.

Monks, an elder monk endowed with these five qualities is dear and agreeable to his fellow monks, respected and esteemed." The first.
