## AN 5.18 The Second Discourse on Benefit

18. ‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu parahitāya paṭipanno hoti, no attahitāya. Katamehi pañcahi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu attanā na sīlasampanno hoti, paraṃ sīlasampadāya samādapeti; attanā na samādhisampanno hoti, paraṃ samādhisampadāya samādapeti; attanā na paññāsampanno hoti, paraṃ paññāsampadāya samādapeti; attanā na vimuttisampanno hoti, paraṃ vimuttisampadāya samādapeti; attanā na vimuttiñāṇadassanasampanno hoti, paraṃ vimuttiñāṇadassanasampadāya samādapeti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu parahitāya paṭipanno hoti, no attahitāyā’’ti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

18. "Monks, a monk endowed with five qualities is practicing for the benefit of others, not for his own benefit. What five? Here, monks, a monk is not himself accomplished in morality, but encourages others in the accomplishment of morality; he is not himself accomplished in concentration, but encourages others in the accomplishment of concentration; he is not himself accomplished in wisdom, but encourages others in the accomplishment of wisdom; he is not himself accomplished in liberation, but encourages others in the accomplishment of liberation; he is not himself accomplished in the knowledge and vision of liberation, but encourages others in the accomplishment of the knowledge and vision of liberation. Monks, a monk endowed with these five qualities is practicing for the benefit of others, not for his own benefit." The eighth.
