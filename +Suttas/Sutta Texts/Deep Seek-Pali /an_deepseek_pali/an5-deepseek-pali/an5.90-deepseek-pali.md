## AN 5.90 The Second Discourse on the Adept

90. ‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, dhammā sekhassa bhikkhuno parihānāya saṃvattanti. Katame pañca? Idha, bhikkhave, sekho bhikkhu bahukicco hoti bahukaraṇīyo viyatto kiṃkaraṇīyesu; riñcati paṭisallānaṃ, nānuyuñjati ajjhattaṃ cetosamathaṃ. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, paṭhamo dhammo sekhassa bhikkhuno parihānāya saṃvattati.

90."Monks, these five qualities lead to the decline of a bhikkhu in training. What five? Here, monks, a bhikkhu in training is one of many activities, one of many involvements, skilled in what needs to be done; he abandons seclusion and does not apply himself to internal serenity of mind. This, monks, is the first quality that leads to the decline of a bhikkhu in training."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, sekho bhikkhu appamattakena kammena divasaṃ atināmeti; riñcati paṭisallānaṃ, nānuyuñjati ajjhattaṃ cetosamathaṃ. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, dutiyo dhammo sekhassa bhikkhuno parihānāya saṃvattati.

"Furthermore, monks, a bhikkhu in training spends the day engaged in trifling activities; he abandons seclusion and does not apply himself to internal serenity of mind. This, monks, is the second quality that leads to the decline of a bhikkhu in training."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, sekho bhikkhu saṃsaṭṭho viharati gahaṭṭhapabbajitehi ananulomikena gihisaṃsaggena; riñcati paṭisallānaṃ, nānuyuñjati ajjhattaṃ cetosamathaṃ. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, tatiyo dhammo sekhassa bhikkhuno parihānāya saṃvattati.

"Furthermore, monks, a bhikkhu in training lives in close association with householders and renunciates in an unsuitable lay association. He abandons seclusion and does not apply himself to internal serenity of mind. This, monks, is the third quality that leads to the decline of a bhikkhu in training."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, sekho bhikkhu akālena gāmaṃ pavisati, atidivā paṭikkamati; riñcati paṭisallānaṃ, nānuyuñjati ajjhattaṃ cetosamathaṃ. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, catuttho dhammo sekhassa bhikkhuno parihānāya saṃvattati.

"Furthermore, monks, a bhikkhu in training enters a village too early and returns too late in the day; he abandons seclusion and does not apply himself to internal serenity of mind. This, monks, is the fourth quality that leads to the decline of a bhikkhu in training."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, sekho bhikkhu yāyaṃ kathā ābhisallekhikā cetovivaraṇasappāyā, seyyathidaṃ – appicchakathā santuṭṭhikathā pavivekakathā asaṃsaggakathā vīriyārambhakathā sīlakathā samādhikathā paññākathā vimuttikathā vimuttiñāṇadassanakathā, evarūpiyā kathāya na nikāmalābhī hoti na akicchalābhī na akasiralābhī [kicchalābhī kasiralābhī (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī)]; riñcati paṭisallānaṃ, nānuyuñjati ajjhattaṃ cetosamathaṃ. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, pañcamo dhammo sekhassa bhikkhuno parihānāya saṃvattati. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca dhammā sekhassa bhikkhuno parihānāya saṃvattanti.

"Furthermore, monks, a bhikkhu in training does not obtain at will, without difficulty, without trouble, the kind of talk that is conducive to effacement and to the opening of the mind—that is to say, talk about fewness of wishes, talk about contentment, talk about seclusion, talk about non-association, talk about arousing energy, talk about virtue, talk about concentration, talk about wisdom, talk about liberation, talk about the knowledge and vision of liberation. He abandons seclusion and does not apply himself to internal serenity of mind. This, monks, is the fifth quality that leads to the decline of a bhikkhu in training. These, monks, are the five qualities that lead to the decline of a bhikkhu in training."

‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, dhammā sekhassa bhikkhuno aparihānāya saṃvattanti. Katame pañca? Idha, bhikkhave, sekho bhikkhu na bahukicco hoti na bahukaraṇīyo viyatto kiṃkaraṇīyesu; na riñcati paṭisallānaṃ, anuyuñjati ajjhattaṃ cetosamathaṃ. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, paṭhamo dhammo sekhassa bhikkhuno aparihānāya saṃvattati.

"Monks, these five qualities lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu in training. What five? Here, monks, a bhikkhu in training is not one with many activities or much to do; he is skilled in what needs to be done. He does not abandon seclusion and applies himself to internal serenity of mind. This, monks, is the first quality that leads to the non-decline of a bhikkhu in training."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, sekho bhikkhu na appamattakena kammena divasaṃ atināmeti; na riñcati paṭisallānaṃ, anuyuñjati ajjhattaṃ cetosamathaṃ. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, dutiyo dhammo sekhassa bhikkhuno aparihānāya saṃvattati.

"Furthermore, monks, a bhikkhu in training does not spend the day with trifling activities; he does not abandon seclusion, but applies himself to internal serenity of mind. This, monks, is the second quality that leads to the non-decline of a bhikkhu in training."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, sekho bhikkhu asaṃsaṭṭho viharati gahaṭṭhapabbajitehi ananulomikena gihisaṃsaggena; na riñcati paṭisallānaṃ, anuyuñjati ajjhattaṃ cetosamathaṃ. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, tatiyo dhammo sekhassa bhikkhuno aparihānāya saṃvattati.

"Furthermore, monks, a bhikkhu in training lives without close association with householders and renunciates in unsuitable lay association. He does not abandon seclusion, and he applies himself to internal serenity of mind. This, monks, is the third quality that leads to the non-decline of a bhikkhu in training."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, sekho bhikkhu na atikālena gāmaṃ pavisati, nātidivā paṭikkamati; na riñcati paṭisallānaṃ, anuyuñjati ajjhattaṃ cetosamathaṃ. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, catuttho dhammo sekhassa bhikkhuno aparihānāya saṃvattati.

"Furthermore, monks, a bhikkhu in training does not enter the village too early, nor return too late in the day. He does not abandon seclusion, but applies himself to internal serenity of mind. This, monks, is the fourth quality that leads to the non-decline of a bhikkhu in training."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, sekho bhikkhu yāyaṃ kathā ābhisallekhikā cetovivaraṇasappāyā, seyyathidaṃ – appicchakathā santuṭṭhikathā pavivekakathā asaṃsaggakathā vīriyārambhakathā sīlakathā samādhikathā paññākathā vimuttikathā vimuttiñāṇadassanakathā, evarūpiyā kathāya nikāmalābhī hoti akicchalābhī akasiralābhī; na riñcati paṭisallānaṃ, anuyuñjati ajjhattaṃ cetosamathaṃ. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, pañcamo dhammo sekhassa bhikkhuno aparihānāya saṃvattati. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca dhammā sekhassa bhikkhuno aparihānāya saṃvattantī’’ti. Dasamaṃ.

"Furthermore, monks, a bhikkhu in training obtains at will, without difficulty, without trouble, the kind of talk that is conducive to effacement and to the opening of the mind—such as talk about fewness of wishes, talk about contentment, talk about seclusion, talk about non-association, talk about arousing energy, talk about virtue, talk about concentration, talk about wisdom, talk about liberation, talk about the knowledge and vision of liberation. He does not abandon seclusion, and he applies himself to internal serenity of mind. This, monks, is the fifth quality that leads to the non-decline of a bhikkhu in training. These, monks, are the five qualities that lead to the non-decline of a bhikkhu in training." The tenth.

Theravaggo catuttho.
