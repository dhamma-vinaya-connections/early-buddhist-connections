# AN 5.73 Paṭhamadhammavihārīsuttaṃ

## AN 5.73 The First Discourse on Abiding in the Dhamma

73. Atha kho aññataro bhikkhu yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho so bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘‘dhammavihārī, dhammavihārī’ti, bhante, vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, bhikkhu dhammavihārī hotī’’ti?

73.Then a certain monk approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, that monk said to the Blessed One: "'One who dwells in the Dhamma, one who dwells in the Dhamma,' it is said, venerable sir. To what extent, venerable sir, is a monk one who dwells in the Dhamma?"

‘‘Idha, bhikkhu, bhikkhu dhammaṃ pariyāpuṇāti – suttaṃ, geyyaṃ, veyyākaraṇaṃ, gāthaṃ, udānaṃ, itivuttakaṃ, jātakaṃ, abbhutadhammaṃ, vedallaṃ. So tāya dhammapariyattiyā divasaṃ atināmeti, riñcati paṭisallānaṃ, nānuyuñjati ajjhattaṃ cetosamathaṃ. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhu – ‘bhikkhu pariyattibahulo, no dhammavihārī’’’.

"Here, monks, a monk learns the Dhamma—discourses, mixed prose and verse, explanations, verses, inspired utterances, Thus-saids, birth stories, marvelous qualities, and analytical teachings. He spends the day engaged in that learning of the Dhamma, neglecting seclusion, and does not apply himself to internal tranquility of mind. Such a monk, monks, is called ‘a monk who is abundant in learning, but not one who abides in the Dhamma.’"

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhu, bhikkhu yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ vitthārena paresaṃ deseti. So tāya dhammapaññattiyā divasaṃ atināmeti, riñcati paṭisallānaṃ, nānuyuñjati ajjhattaṃ cetosamathaṃ. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhu – ‘bhikkhu paññattibahulo, no dhammavihārī’’’.

"Furthermore, monks, a monk teaches the Dhamma in detail to others as he has heard and learned it. He spends the day engaged in that exposition of the Dhamma, neglecting seclusion, and does not apply himself to internal tranquility of mind. Such a monk, monks, is called ‘a monk who is much in exposition, but not one who abides in the Dhamma.’"

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhu, bhikkhu yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ vitthārena sajjhāyaṃ karoti. So tena sajjhāyena divasaṃ atināmeti, riñcati paṭisallānaṃ, nānuyuñjati ajjhattaṃ cetosamathaṃ. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhu – ‘bhikkhu sajjhāyabahulo, no dhammavihārī’’’.

"Furthermore, monks, a monk recites the Dhamma in detail just as he has heard it, just as he has learned it. He spends the day engaged in that recitation, neglecting seclusion, and does not apply himself to internal tranquility of mind. Such a monk, monks, is called ‘a monk who is much given to recitation, but not one who abides in the Dhamma.’"

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhu, bhikkhu yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ cetasā anuvitakketi anuvicāreti manasānupekkhati. So tehi dhammavitakkehi divasaṃ atināmeti, riñcati paṭisallānaṃ, nānuyuñjati ajjhattaṃ cetosamathaṃ. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhu – ‘bhikkhu vitakkabahulo, no dhammavihārī’’’.

"Furthermore, monks, a monk reflects upon and examines with his mind the Dhamma he has heard and learned, considering it with his mind. He spends the day engaged in those thoughts, neglecting seclusion, and does not apply himself to internal tranquility of mind. Such a monk, monks, is called ‘a monk who is full of thinking, but not one who abides in the Dhamma.’"

‘‘Idha, bhikkhu, bhikkhu dhammaṃ pariyāpuṇāti – suttaṃ, geyyaṃ, veyyākaraṇaṃ, gāthaṃ, udānaṃ, itivuttakaṃ, jātakaṃ, abbhutadhammaṃ, vedallaṃ. So tāya dhammapariyattiyā na divasaṃ atināmeti, nāpi riñcati paṭisallānaṃ, anuyuñjati ajjhattaṃ cetosamathaṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhu, bhikkhu dhammavihārī hoti.

"Here, monks, a monk learns the Dhamma—discourses, mixed prose and verse, explanations, verses, inspired utterances, Thus-saids, birth stories, marvelous qualities, and analytical teachings. He does not spend his day engaged in that learning of the Dhamma, nor does he neglect seclusion, but applies himself to internal tranquility of mind. Thus, monks, a monk abides in the Dhamma."

‘‘Iti kho, bhikkhu, desito mayā pariyattibahulo, desito paññattibahulo, desito sajjhāyabahulo, desito vitakkabahulo, desito dhammavihārī. Yaṃ kho, bhikkhu [yaṃ bhikkhu (syā. kaṃ. pī.)], satthārā karaṇīyaṃ sāvakānaṃ hitesinā anukampakena anukampaṃ upādāya, kataṃ vo taṃ mayā. Etāni, bhikkhu, rukkhamūlāni, etāni suññāgārāni. Jhāyatha, bhikkhu, mā pamādattha, mā pacchā vippaṭisārino ahuvattha. Ayaṃ vo amhākaṃ anusāsanī’’ti. Tatiyaṃ.

"Thus, monks, I have taught the one who is abundant in learning, the one who is abundant in exposition, the one who is abundant in recitation, the one who is abundant in thinking, and the one who abides in the Dhamma. Whatever a teacher should do for his disciples, seeking their welfare, out of compassion, that I have done for you. These, monks, are the roots of trees, these are empty dwellings. Meditate, monks, do not be heedless, lest you regret it later. This is our instruction to you." (Third)
