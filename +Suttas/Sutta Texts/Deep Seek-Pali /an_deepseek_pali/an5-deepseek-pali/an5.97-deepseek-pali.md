# AN 5.97 Kathāsuttaṃ

## AN 5.97 The Discourse on Talk

97. ‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu ānāpānassatiṃ bhāvento nacirasseva akuppaṃ paṭivijjhati. Katamehi pañcahi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu appaṭṭho hoti appakicco subharo susantoso jīvitaparikkhāresu; appāhāro hoti anodarikattaṃ anuyutto; appamiddho hoti jāgariyaṃ anuyutto; yāyaṃ kathā ābhisallekhikā cetovivaraṇasappāyā, seyyathidaṃ – appicchakathā…pe… vimuttiñāṇadassanakathā, evarūpiyā kathāya nikāmalābhī hoti akicchalābhī akasiralābhī; yathāvimuttaṃ cittaṃ paccavekkhati. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu ānāpānassatiṃ bhāvento nacirasseva akuppaṃ paṭivijjhatī’’ti. Sattamaṃ.

97.“Monks, a monk endowed with five qualities, developing mindfulness of breathing, will soon penetrate the unshakable. What five? Here, monks, a monk has few wants and few duties, is easy to support, and is content with the requisites of life; he eats little, devoted to not filling his belly; he is of little sleep, devoted to wakefulness; he obtains at will, without trouble or difficulty, talk that is conducive to scouring away defilements and to the opening of the heart, such as talk on fewness of wishes…talk on the knowledge and vision of liberation; he reviews his mind as it is liberated. Monks, a monk endowed with these five qualities, developing mindfulness of breathing, will soon penetrate the unshakable.” The seventh.
