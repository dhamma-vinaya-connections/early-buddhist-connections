## AN 5.76 The Second Discourse on the Warrior

76. ‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, yodhājīvā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ. Katame pañca? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco yodhājīvo asicammaṃ gahetvā dhanukalāpaṃ sannayhitvā viyūḷhaṃ saṅgāmaṃ otarati. So tasmiṃ saṅgāme ussahati vāyamati. Tamenaṃ ussahantaṃ vāyamantaṃ pare hananti pariyāpādenti. Evarūpopi, bhikkhave, idhekacco yodhājīvo hoti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, paṭhamo yodhājīvo santo saṃvijjamāno lokasmiṃ.

76."Monks, these five kinds of warriors are found existing in the world. What five? Here, monks, a certain warrior takes up sword and shield, equips himself with bow and quiver, and plunges into the battle array. He strives and exerts himself in that battle. While he is striving and exerting himself, others strike him down and dispatch him. Such a warrior, monks, is found here. This, monks, is the first kind of warrior found existing in the world."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, idhekacco yodhājīvo asicammaṃ gahetvā dhanukalāpaṃ sannayhitvā viyūḷhaṃ saṅgāmaṃ otarati. So tasmiṃ saṅgāme ussahati vāyamati. Tamenaṃ ussahantaṃ vāyamantaṃ pare upalikkhanti [upalikhanti (ka.)], tamenaṃ apanenti; apanetvā ñātakānaṃ nenti. So ñātakehi nīyamāno appatvāva ñātake antarāmagge kālaṃ karoti. Evarūpopi, bhikkhave, idhekacco yodhājīvo hoti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, dutiyo yodhājīvo santo saṃvijjamāno lokasmiṃ.

"Furthermore, monks, here a certain warrior takes up sword and shield, equips himself with bow and quiver, and plunges into the battle array. He strives and exerts himself in that battle. While he is striving and exerting himself, others wound him, then carry him away. After carrying him away, they bring him to his relatives. While being carried away by his relatives, he dies along the way, not having reached them. Such a warrior, monks, is found here. This, monks, is the second kind of warrior found existing in the world."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, idhekacco yodhājīvo asicammaṃ gahetvā dhanukalāpaṃ sannayhitvā viyūḷhaṃ saṅgāmaṃ otarati. So tasmiṃ saṅgāme ussahati vāyamati. Tamenaṃ ussahantaṃ vāyamantaṃ pare upalikkhanti, tamenaṃ apanenti; apanetvā ñātakānaṃ nenti. Tamenaṃ ñātakā upaṭṭhahanti paricaranti. So ñātakehi upaṭṭhahiyamāno paricariyamāno teneva ābādhena kālaṃ karoti. Evarūpopi, bhikkhave, idhekacco yodhājīvo hoti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, tatiyo yodhājīvo santo saṃvijjamāno lokasmiṃ.

"Furthermore, monks, here a certain warrior takes up sword and shield, equips himself with bow and quiver, and plunges into the battle array. He strives and exerts himself in that battle. While he is striving and exerting himself, others wound him, then carry him away. After carrying him away, they bring him to his relatives. His relatives attend to him and care for him. While being attended to and cared for by his relatives, he dies from that very affliction. Such a warrior, monks, is found here. This, monks, is the third kind of warrior found existing in the world."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, idhekacco yodhājīvo asicammaṃ gahetvā dhanukalāpaṃ sannayhitvā viyūḷhaṃ saṅgāmaṃ otarati. So tasmiṃ saṅgāme ussahati vāyamati. Tamenaṃ ussahantaṃ vāyamantaṃ pare upalikkhanti, tamenaṃ apanenti; apanetvā ñātakānaṃ nenti. Tamenaṃ ñātakā upaṭṭhahanti paricaranti. So ñātakehi upaṭṭhahiyamāno paricariyamāno vuṭṭhāti tamhā ābādhā. Evarūpopi, bhikkhave, idhekacco yodhājīvo hoti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, catuttho yodhājīvo santo saṃvijjamāno lokasmiṃ.

"Furthermore, monks, here a certain warrior takes up sword and shield, equips himself with bow and quiver, and plunges into the battle array. He strives and exerts himself in that battle. While he is striving and exerting himself, others wound him, then carry him away. After carrying him away, they bring him to his relatives. His relatives attend to him and care for him. While being attended to and cared for by his relatives, he recovers from that affliction. Such a warrior, monks, is found here. This, monks, is the fourth kind of warrior found existing in the world."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, idhekacco yodhājīvo asicammaṃ gahetvā dhanukalāpaṃ sannayhitvā viyūḷhaṃ saṅgāmaṃ otarati. So taṃ saṅgāmaṃ abhivijinitvā vijitasaṅgāmo tameva saṅgāmasīsaṃ ajjhāvasati. Evarūpopi, bhikkhave, idhekacco yodhājīvo hoti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, pañcamo yodhājīvo santo saṃvijjamāno lokasmiṃ. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca yodhājīvā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ.

"Furthermore, monks, here a certain warrior takes up sword and shield, equips himself with bow and quiver, and plunges into the battle array. He conquers that battle and, having conquered the battle, he dwells at the head of that battlefield. Such a warrior, monks, is found here. This, monks, is the fifth kind of warrior found existing in the world. These, monks, are the five kinds of warriors found existing in the world."

‘‘Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, pañcime yodhājīvūpamā puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā bhikkhūsu. Katame pañca? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu aññataraṃ gāmaṃ vā nigamaṃ vā upanissāya viharati. So pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya tameva gāmaṃ vā nigamaṃ vā piṇḍāya pavisati arakkhiteneva kāyena arakkhitāya vācāya arakkhitena cittena anupaṭṭhitāya satiyā asaṃvutehi indriyehi. So tattha passati mātugāmaṃ dunnivatthaṃ vā duppārutaṃ vā. Tassa taṃ mātugāmaṃ disvā dunnivatthaṃ vā duppārutaṃ vā rāgo cittaṃ anuddhaṃseti. So rāgānuddhaṃsitena cittena sikkhaṃ apaccakkhāya dubbalyaṃ anāvikatvā methunaṃ dhammaṃ paṭisevati.

"Just so, monks, these five kinds of persons comparable to warriors are found existing among the bhikkhus. What five? Here, monks, a bhikkhu lives dependent on a certain village or town. In the morning, having dressed, he takes his bowl and robe and enters that same village or town for alms—with body unguarded, with speech unguarded, with mind unguarded, with mindfulness unestablished, and with senses unrestrained. There he sees a woman scantily clad or lightly dressed. Upon seeing that woman scantily clad or lightly dressed, lust overwhelms his mind. With his mind overwhelmed by lust, without renouncing the training, without declaring his weakness, he engages in sexual intercourse."

‘‘Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, yodhājīvo asicammaṃ gahetvā dhanukalāpaṃ sannayhitvā viyūḷhaṃ saṅgāmaṃ otarati, so tasmiṃ saṅgāme ussahati vāyamati, tamenaṃ ussahantaṃ vāyamantaṃ pare hananti pariyāpādenti; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi. Evarūpopi, bhikkhave, idhekacco puggalo hoti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, paṭhamo yodhājīvūpamo puggalo santo saṃvijjamāno bhikkhūsu.

"Just as, monks, that warrior takes up sword and shield, equips himself with bow and quiver, and plunges into the battle array. He strives and exerts himself in that battle. While he is striving and exerting himself, others strike him down and dispatch him. Monks, I say that this person is comparable to that. Such a person, monks, is found here. This, monks, is the first kind of person comparable to a warrior found existing among the bhikkhus."

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu aññataraṃ gāmaṃ vā nigamaṃ vā upanissāya viharati. So pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya tameva gāmaṃ vā nigamaṃ vā piṇḍāya pavisati arakkhiteneva kāyena arakkhitāya vācāya arakkhitena cittena anupaṭṭhitāya satiyā asaṃvutehi indriyehi. So tattha passati mātugāmaṃ dunnivatthaṃ vā duppārutaṃ vā. Tassa taṃ mātugāmaṃ disvā dunnivatthaṃ vā duppārutaṃ vā rāgo cittaṃ anuddhaṃseti. So rāgānuddhaṃsitena cittena pariḍayhateva kāyena pariḍayhati cetasā. Tassa evaṃ hoti – ‘yaṃnūnāhaṃ ārāmaṃ gantvā bhikkhūnaṃ āroceyyaṃ – rāgapariyuṭṭhitomhi [rāgāyitomhi (sī. syā. kaṃ)], āvuso, rāgapareto, na sakkomi brahmacariyaṃ sandhāretuṃ; sikkhādubbalyaṃ āvikatvā sikkhaṃ paccakkhāya hīnāyāvattissāmī’ti. So ārāmaṃ gacchanto appatvāva ārāmaṃ antarāmagge sikkhādubbalyaṃ āvikatvā sikkhaṃ paccakkhāya hīnāyāvattati.

"Furthermore, monks, a bhikkhu dwells dependent on a certain village or town. In the morning, having dressed, he takes his bowl and robe and enters that same village or town for alms—with body unguarded, with speech unguarded, with mind unguarded, with mindfulness unestablished, and with senses unrestrained. There he sees a woman scantily clad or lightly dressed. Upon seeing that woman scantily clad or lightly dressed, lust overwhelms his mind. With his mind overwhelmed by lust, he is consumed in body and consumed in mind. He thinks: ‘Suppose I go to the monastery and inform the bhikkhus: "Friends, I am beset by lust, overcome by lust; I cannot maintain the holy life. Having declared my weakness in the training, I will renounce the training and return to the lower life."’ Then, while going to the monastery, before even reaching the monastery, along the way, he declares his weakness in the training, renounces the training, and returns to the lower life."

‘‘Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, yodhājīvo asicammaṃ gahetvā dhanukalāpaṃ sannayhitvā viyūḷhaṃ saṅgāmaṃ otarati, so tasmiṃ saṅgāme ussahati vāyamati, tamenaṃ ussahantaṃ vāyamantaṃ pare upalikkhanti, tamenaṃ apanenti; apanetvā ñātakānaṃ nenti.

“Then his fellow monks advise and instruct him: ‘Friend, sensual pleasures have been declared by the Blessed One to have little gratification, much suffering, much tribulation, and the danger in them is still greater. Sensual pleasures have been declared by the Blessed One to be like a skeleton, with much suffering, much tribulation, and the danger in them is still greater. Sensual pleasures have been declared by the Blessed One to be like a piece of flesh, with much suffering, much tribulation, and the danger in them is still greater. Sensual pleasures have been declared by the Blessed One to be like a grass torch, with much suffering, much tribulation, and the danger in them is still greater. Sensual pleasures have been declared by the Blessed One to be like a pit of glowing coals, with much suffering, much tribulation, and the danger in them is still greater. Sensual pleasures have been declared by the Blessed One to be like a dream, with much suffering, much tribulation, and the danger in them is still greater. Sensual pleasures have been declared by the Blessed One to be like borrowed goods, with much suffering, much tribulation, and the danger in them is still greater. Sensual pleasures have been declared by the Blessed One to be like fruits on a tree, with much suffering, much tribulation, and the danger in them is still greater. Sensual pleasures have been declared by the Blessed One to be like a butcher’s knife, with much suffering, much tribulation, and the danger in them is still greater. Sensual pleasures have been declared by the Blessed One to be like a stake and spear, with much suffering, much tribulation, and the danger in them is still greater. Sensual pleasures have been declared by the Blessed One to be like a snake’s head, with much suffering, much tribulation, and the danger in them is still greater. Let the venerable one delight in the holy life; let the venerable one not, by revealing his weakness in the training, renounce the training and return to the lower life.’

‘‘So sabrahmacārīhi evaṃ ovadiyamāno evaṃ anusāsiyamāno evamāha – ‘kiñcāpi, āvuso, appassādā kāmā vuttā bhagavatā bahudukkhā bahupāyāsā, ādīnavo ettha bhiyyo; atha kho nevāhaṃ sakkomi brahmacariyaṃ sandhāretuṃ, sikkhādubbalyaṃ āvikatvā sikkhaṃ paccakkhāya hīnāyāvattissāmī’’’ti. So sikkhādubbalyaṃ āvikatvā sikkhaṃ paccakkhāya hīnāyāvattati.

Though thus advised and instructed by his fellow monks, he says: ‘Even though, friends, sensual pleasures have been declared by the Blessed One to have little gratification, much suffering, much tribulation, and greater danger, still I cannot sustain the holy life. Having revealed my weakness in the training, I shall renounce the training and return to the lower life.’ So he reveals his weakness in the training, renounces the training, and returns to the lower life.

‘‘Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, yodhājīvo asicammaṃ gahetvā dhanukalāpaṃ sannayhitvā viyūḷhaṃ saṅgāmaṃ otarati, so tasmiṃ saṅgāme ussahati vāyamati, tamenaṃ ussahantaṃ vāyamantaṃ pare upalikkhanti, tamenaṃ apanenti; apanetvā ñātakānaṃ nenti, tamenaṃ ñātakā upaṭṭhahanti paricaranti.

“Just as, bhikkhus, a warrior, taking up his sword and shield, fitting his bow and quiver, plunges into a battle formation. He strives and exerts himself in that battle, but his enemies wound him and carry him away. Having carried him away, they take him to his relatives, and his relatives tend to him and care for him. While being tended and cared for by his relatives, he dies from that very affliction. Such a person, bhikkhus, I say is like this. Such a person, bhikkhus, is found here. This, bhikkhus, is the third kind of person comparable to a warrior found existing among bhikkhus.

“Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lives dependent on a certain village or town. In the morning, having dressed, he takes his bowl and robe and enters that village or town for alms—with body unguarded, speech unguarded, mind unguarded, mindfulness unestablished, and senses unrestrained. There he sees a woman poorly dressed or poorly covered. Upon seeing that woman poorly dressed or poorly covered, lust assails his mind. With his mind assailed by lust, he is consumed by passion in body and mind. He thinks: ‘Suppose I were to go to the monastery and tell the bhikkhus: “Friends, I am obsessed by lust, overcome by lust. I cannot sustain the holy life. Having revealed my weakness in the training, I shall renounce the training and return to the lower life.”’ So he goes to the monastery and tells the bhikkhus: ‘Friends, I am obsessed by lust, overcome by lust.

“Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lives dependent on a certain village or town. In the morning, having dressed, he takes his bowl and robe and enters that village or town for alms, with body guarded, speech guarded, mind guarded, mindfulness established, and senses restrained. Having seen a form with the eye, he is not a taker of its signs and features. Because, if he were to dwell with the eye faculty unrestrained, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might flow in upon him, he practices restraint for its control; he guards the eye faculty; he achieves restraint over the eye faculty. Having heard a sound with the ear… smelled an odor with the nose… tasted a flavor with the tongue… touched a tangible with the body… cognized a mental object with the mind, he is not a taker of its signs and features. Because, if he were to dwell with the mind faculty unrestrained, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might flow in upon him, he practices restraint for its control; he guards the mind faculty; he achieves restraint over the mind faculty. After his meal, returning from his alms round, he resorts to a secluded lodging: a forest, the root of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a jungle thicket, an open space, or a heap of straw. Having gone to the forest, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishing mindfulness in front of him. He abandons covetousness for the world, and dwells with a mind free from covetousness, purifying his mind from covetousness. He abandons ill will and hatred, and dwells with a mind free from ill will, compassionate for all living beings, purifying his mind from ill will and hatred. He abandons sloth and torpor, and dwells free from sloth and torpor, perceiving light, mindful and clearly comprehending, purifying his mind from sloth and torpor. He abandons restlessness and remorse, and dwells unagitated, with a mind inwardly peaceful, purifying his mind from restlessness and remorse. He abandons doubt, and dwells having crossed over doubt, without perplexity regarding wholesome states, purifying his mind from doubt. Having abandoned these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion. With the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without thought and examination, and has rapture and happiness born of concentration. With the fading away of rapture, he dwells in equanimity, mindful and clearly comprehending, and experiences happiness with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna, of which the noble ones declare: ‘He dwells in equanimity, mindful, and happy.’ With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the prior disappearance of joy and grief, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is neither painful nor pleasant and is purified by equanimity and mindfulness.

‘‘So evaṃ samāhite citte parisuddhe pariyodāte anaṅgaṇe vigatūpakkilese mudubhūte kammaniye ṭhite āneñjappatte āsavānaṃ khayañāṇāya cittaṃ abhininnāmeti. So ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti…pe… nāparaṃ itthattāyāti pajānāti’’.

When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilements, pliant, workable, steady, and imperturbable, he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the destruction of the taints. He understands as it actually is: ‘This is suffering’; he understands as it actually is: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; he understands as it actually is: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; he understands as it actually is: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’ He understands: ‘There is no more coming to any state of being.’

‘‘Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, yodhājīvo asicammaṃ gahetvā dhanukalāpaṃ sannayhitvā viyūḷhaṃ saṅgāmaṃ otarati, so taṃ saṅgāmaṃ abhivijinitvā vijitasaṅgāmo tameva saṅgāmasīsaṃ ajjhāvasati; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi. Evarūpopi, bhikkhave, idhekacco puggalo hoti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, pañcamo yodhājīvūpamo puggalo santo saṃvijjamāno bhikkhūsu. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca yodhājīvūpamā puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā bhikkhūsū’’ti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

Just as, monks, a warrior, taking his sword and shield and fitting his bow and quiver, plunges into battle, fully arrayed. Having completely conquered that battle and emerged victorious, he remains right there at the head of the battle. Such, monks, is the person I describe. Such a person, monks, is found here. This, monks, is the fifth person comparable to a warrior found among the bhikkhus. These, monks, are the five persons comparable to a warrior found among the bhikkhus.
