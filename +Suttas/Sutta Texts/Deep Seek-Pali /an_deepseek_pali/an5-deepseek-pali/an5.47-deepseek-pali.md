# AN 5.47 Dhanasuttaṃ

## AN 5.47 The Discourse on Wealth

47. ‘‘Pañcimāni, bhikkhave, dhanāni. Katamāni pañca? Saddhādhanaṃ, sīladhanaṃ, sutadhanaṃ, cāgadhanaṃ, paññādhanaṃ.

47.Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of wealth. What five? The wealth of faith, the wealth of virtue, the wealth of learning, the wealth of generosity, and the wealth of wisdom.

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, saddhādhanaṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako saddho hoti, saddahati tathāgatassa bodhiṃ – ‘itipi so bhagavā…pe… satthā devamanussānaṃ buddho bhagavā’ti. Idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, saddhādhanaṃ.

And what, bhikkhus, is the wealth of faith? Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple is endowed with faith; he places faith in the Tathāgata’s enlightenment thus: ‘Indeed, the Blessed One is an Arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed guide for those desiring training, teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One.’ This, bhikkhus, is called the wealth of faith.

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, sīladhanaṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako pāṇātipātā paṭivirato hoti…pe… surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā paṭivirato hoti. Idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, sīladhanaṃ.

And what, bhikkhus, is the wealth of virtue? Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. This, bhikkhus, is called the wealth of virtue.

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, sutadhanaṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako bahussuto hoti…pe… diṭṭhiyā suppaṭividdho. Idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, sutadhanaṃ.

And what, bhikkhus, is the wealth of learning? Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple is learned, remembering what he has heard, storing it up. He has heard much, retained it, and accumulated it. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and purified holy life—such teachings he has learned well, retained, recited, pondered, and penetrated well by means of wisdom. This, bhikkhus, is called the wealth of learning.

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, cāgadhanaṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako vigatamalamaccherena cetasā agāraṃ ajjhāvasati muttacāgo payatapāṇi vossaggarato yācayogo dānasaṃvibhāgarato. Idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, cāgadhanaṃ.

And what, bhikkhus, is the wealth of generosity? Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple dwells at home with a mind devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, open-handed, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing. This, bhikkhus, is called the wealth of generosity.

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, paññādhanaṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako paññavā hoti, udayatthagāminiyā paññāya samannāgato ariyāya nibbedhikāya sammā dukkhakkhayagāminiyā. Idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, paññādhanaṃ. Imāni kho, bhikkhave, pañca dhanānī’’ti.

And what, bhikkhus, is the wealth of wisdom? Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple is wise, endowed with wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. This, bhikkhus, is called the wealth of wisdom. These, bhikkhus, are the five kinds of wealth.

[a. ni. 4.52] ‘‘Yassa saddhā tathāgate, acalā suppatiṭṭhitā;Sīlañca yassa kalyāṇaṃ, ariyakantaṃ pasaṃsitaṃ.

One whose faith in the Tathāgata is unshakeable, well established; and whose virtue is beautiful, esteemed by the noble ones, praised;

‘‘Saṅghe pasādo yassatthi, ujubhūtañca dassanaṃ;Adaliddoti taṃ āhu, amoghaṃ tassa jīvitaṃ.

who has confidence in the Saṅgha, and whose vision is upright and straight—they say that person is not poor, their life is not in vain.

‘‘Tasmā saddhañca sīlañca, pasādaṃ dhammadassanaṃ;Anuyuñjetha medhāvī, saraṃ buddhāna sāsana’’nti. sattamaṃ;

Therefore, the wise person should cultivate faith, virtue, serenity, and vision of the Dhamma, remembering the Buddhas’ teaching.
