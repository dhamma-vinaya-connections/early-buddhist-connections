He has attained the analytical knowledge of meaning, the analytical knowledge of the Dhamma, the analytical knowledge of language, and the analytical knowledge of ready wit; and he is skilled and tireless in those various duties of his fellow practitioners—whatever they may be—and is endowed with the wisdom to investigate the means to accomplish them, being capable of acting and managing. Monks, an elder monk endowed with these five qualities is dear and agreeable to his fellow practitioners, respected and esteemed.”
