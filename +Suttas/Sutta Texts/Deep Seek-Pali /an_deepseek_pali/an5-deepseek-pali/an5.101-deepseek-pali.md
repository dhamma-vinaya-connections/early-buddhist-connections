# AN 5.101 Sārajjasuttaṃ

## AN 5.101 The Discourse on Dismay

101. ‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, sekhavesārajjakaraṇā dhammā. Katame pañca? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu saddho hoti, sīlavā hoti, bahussuto hoti, āraddhavīriyo hoti, paññavā hoti.

101."Bhikkhus, these five qualities lead to a trainee's confidence. What five? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has faith, is virtuous, is learned, has aroused energy, and is wise."

‘‘Yaṃ, bhikkhave, assaddhassa sārajjaṃ hoti, saddhassa taṃ sārajjaṃ na hoti. Tasmāyaṃ dhammo sekhavesārajjakaraṇo.

"Bhikkhus, whatever dismay exists in one without faith, that dismay does not exist in one with faith. Therefore, this quality leads to a trainee's confidence."

‘‘Yaṃ, bhikkhave, dussīlassa sārajjaṃ hoti, sīlavato taṃ sārajjaṃ na hoti. Tasmāyaṃ dhammo sekhavesārajjakaraṇo.

"Bhikkhus, whatever dismay exists in one who is immoral, that dismay does not exist in one who is virtuous. Therefore, this quality leads to a trainee's confidence."

‘‘Yaṃ, bhikkhave, appassutassa sārajjaṃ hoti, bahussutassa taṃ sārajjaṃ na hoti. Tasmāyaṃ dhammo sekhavesārajjakaraṇo.

"Bhikkhus, whatever dismay exists in one who is unlearned, that dismay does not exist in one who is learned. Therefore, this quality leads to a trainee's confidence."

‘‘Yaṃ, bhikkhave, kusītassa sārajjaṃ hoti, āraddhavīriyassa taṃ sārajjaṃ na hoti. Tasmāyaṃ dhammo sekhavesārajjakaraṇo.

"Bhikkhus, whatever dismay exists in one who is lazy, that dismay does not exist in one who has aroused energy. Therefore, this quality leads to a trainee's confidence."

‘‘Yaṃ, bhikkhave, duppaññassa sārajjaṃ hoti, paññavato taṃ sārajjaṃ na hoti. Tasmāyaṃ dhammo sekhavesārajjakaraṇo. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca sekhavesārajjakaraṇā dhammā’’ti. Paṭhamaṃ.

"Bhikkhus, whatever dismay exists in one who is unwise, that dismay does not exist in one who is wise. Therefore, this quality leads to a trainee's confidence. These, bhikkhus, are the five qualities that lead to a trainee's confidence." First.
