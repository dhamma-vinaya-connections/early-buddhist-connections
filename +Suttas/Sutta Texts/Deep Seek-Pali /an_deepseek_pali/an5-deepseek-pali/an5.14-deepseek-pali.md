# AN 5.14 Vitthatasuttaṃ

## AN 5.14 The Detailed Discourse

14. ‘‘Pañcimāni, bhikkhave, balāni. Katamāni pañca? Saddhābalaṃ, vīriyabalaṃ, satibalaṃ, samādhibalaṃ, paññābalaṃ.

14. Monks, there are these five powers. Which five? The power of faith, the power of energy, the power of mindfulness, the power of concentration, the power of wisdom.

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, saddhābalaṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako saddho hoti, saddahati tathāgatassa bodhiṃ – ‘itipi so bhagavā arahaṃ sammāsambuddho vijjācaraṇasampanno sugato lokavidū anuttaro purisadammasārathi satthā devamanussānaṃ buddho bhagavā’ti. Idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, saddhābalaṃ.

"And what, monks, is the power of faith? Here, monks, a noble disciple has faith; he believes in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata: ‘Indeed, the Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, the Blessed One.’ This, monks, is called the power of faith."

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, vīriyabalaṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako āraddhavīriyo viharati akusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ pahānāya, kusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ upasampadāya thāmavā daḷhaparakkamo anikkhittadhuro kusalesu dhammesu. Idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, vīriyabalaṃ.

"And what, monks, is the power of energy? Here, monks, a noble disciple dwells with energy aroused for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is firm, strong in effort, not shirking his duty in regard to wholesome qualities. This, monks, is called the power of energy."

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, satibalaṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako satimā hoti paramena satinepakkena samannāgato, cirakatampi cirabhāsitampi saritā anussaritā. Idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, satibalaṃ.

"And what, monks, is the power of mindfulness? Here, monks, a noble disciple is mindful, endowed with supreme mindfulness and sagacity, one who recollects and remembers what was done and said long ago. This, monks, is called the power of mindfulness."

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, samādhibalaṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati; vitakkavicārānaṃ vūpasamā ajjhattaṃ sampasādanaṃ cetaso ekodibhāvaṃ avitakkaṃ avicāraṃ samādhijaṃ pītisukhaṃ dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati; pītiyā ca virāgā upekkhako ca viharati sato ca sampajāno sukhañca kāyena paṭisaṃvedeti yaṃ taṃ ariyā ācikkhanti – ‘upekkhako satimā sukhavihārī’ti tatiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati; sukhassa ca pahānā dukkhassa ca pahānā pubbeva somanassadomanassānaṃ atthaṅgamā adukkhamasukhaṃ upekkhāsatipārisuddhiṃ catutthaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati. Idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, samādhibalaṃ.

"And what, monks, is the power of concentration? Here, monks, a noble disciple, secluded from sensual pleasures and unwholesome states, enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion. With the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without thought and examination, and has rapture and happiness born of concentration. With the fading away of rapture, he dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending, and experiences happiness with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna, of which the noble ones declare: ‘Equanimous and mindful, he dwells happily.’ With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is neither painful nor pleasant and includes the purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. This, monks, is called the power of concentration."

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, paññābalaṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako paññavā hoti udayatthagāminiyā paññāya samannāgato ariyāya nibbedhikāya sammā dukkhakkhayagāminiyā. Idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, paññābalaṃ. Imāni kho, bhikkhave, pañca balānī’’ti. Catutthaṃ.

"And what, monks, is the power of wisdom? Here, monks, a noble disciple is wise, endowed with the wisdom that discerns rise and fall, noble, penetrative, and leads to the right destruction of suffering. This, monks, is called the power of wisdom. These, monks, are the five powers." (Fourth)
