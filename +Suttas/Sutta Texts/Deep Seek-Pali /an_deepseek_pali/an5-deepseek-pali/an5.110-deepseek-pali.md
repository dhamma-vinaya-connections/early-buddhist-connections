## AN 5.110 The Forest Discourse

110. ‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃ araññavanapatthāni pantāni senāsanāni paṭisevituṃ. Katamehi pañcahi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sīlavā hoti…pe… samādāya sikkhati sikkhāpadesu; bahussuto hoti…pe… diṭṭhiyā suppaṭividdhā; āraddhavīriyo viharati thāmavā daḷhaparakkamo anikkhittadhuro kusalesu dhammesu; catunnaṃ jhānānaṃ ābhicetasikānaṃ diṭṭhadhammasukhavihārānaṃ nikāmalābhī hoti akicchalābhī akasiralābhī; āsavānaṃ khayā anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharati. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu alaṃ araññavanapatthāni pantāni senāsanāni paṭisevitu’’nti. Dasamaṃ.

110.“Monks, a monk endowed with five qualities is fit to resort to remote forest and woodland dwellings. Which five? Here, monks, a monk is virtuous, he dwells restrained by the restraint of the Pātimokkha, perfect in conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults, and trains himself in the training rules he has undertaken; he is learned, one who remembers what he has heard, who stores up what he has heard. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with meaning and with phrasing, proclaiming the perfectly complete and purified holy life—such teachings he has learned much of, retained, recited verbally, mentally examined, and penetrated well by view; he dwells with energy aroused, strong in exertion, firm in his endeavor, not abandoning the burden in regard to wholesome states; he obtains at will, without difficulty or trouble, the four jhānas that pertain to the higher mind, pleasant dwellings in this very life; and through the destruction of the taints, he enters and dwells in the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, having realized it for himself with direct knowledge in this very life. Monks, a monk endowed with these five qualities is fit to resort to remote forest and woodland dwellings.” This is the tenth.
