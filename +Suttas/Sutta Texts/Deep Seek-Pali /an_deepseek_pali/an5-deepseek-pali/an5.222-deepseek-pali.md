# AN 5.222 Dutiyadīghacārikasuttaṃ

## AN 5.222 The Second Discourse on Long Wandering

222. ‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, ādīnavā dīghacārikaṃ anavatthacārikaṃ anuyuttassa viharato. Katame pañca? Anadhigataṃ nādhigacchati, adhigatā parihāyati, adhigatenekaccena avisārado hoti, gāḷhaṃ rogātaṅkaṃ phusati, na ca mittavā hoti. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca ādīnavā dīghacārikaṃ anavatthacārikaṃ anuyuttassa viharato.

222."Monks, there are these five drawbacks for one who lives addicted to long and unsettled wandering. Which five? He does not attain what he has not attained, he declines from what he has attained, he lacks conviction regarding some of what he has attained, he is afflicted by a severe illness, and he is not friendly. These, monks, are the five drawbacks for one who lives addicted to long and unsettled wandering."

‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, ānisaṃsā samavatthacāre. Katame pañca? Anadhigataṃ adhigacchati, adhigatā na parihāyati, adhigatenekaccena visārado hoti, na gāḷhaṃ rogātaṅkaṃ phusati, mittavā ca hoti. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca ānisaṃsā samavatthacāre’’ti. Dutiyaṃ.

"Monks, there are these five benefits of settled conduct. What five? One attains what one has not attained, one does not decline from what one has attained, one becomes confident regarding some of what one has attained, one is not afflicted by severe illness, and one is friendly. These, monks, are the five benefits of settled conduct." Second.
