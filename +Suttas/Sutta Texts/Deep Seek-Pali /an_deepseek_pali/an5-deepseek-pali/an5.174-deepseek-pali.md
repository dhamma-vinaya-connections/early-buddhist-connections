## AN 5.174 The Discourse on Enmities

174. Atha kho anāthapiṇḍiko gahapati yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho anāthapiṇḍikaṃ gahapatiṃ bhagavā etadavoca –

174.Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One, and after approaching and paying homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side. The Blessed One said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, as he was sitting to one side:

‘‘Pañca, gahapati, bhayāni verāni appahāya ‘dussīlo’ iti vuccati, nirayañca upapajjati. Katamāni pañca? Pāṇātipātaṃ, adinnādānaṃ, kāmesumicchācāraṃ, musāvādaṃ, surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānaṃ – imāni kho, gahapati, pañca bhayāni verāni appahāya ‘dussīlo’ iti vuccati, nirayañca upapajjati.

“Householder, without abandoning five fears and enmities, one is called ‘unvirtuous’ and is reborn in hell. Which five? Taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech, and indulgence in intoxicating drinks and drugs that are a basis for heedlessness. Householder, without abandoning these five fears and enmities, one is called ‘unvirtuous’ and is reborn in hell.”

‘‘Pañca, gahapati, bhayāni verāni pahāya ‘sīlavā’ iti vuccati, sugatiñca upapajjati. Katamāni pañca? Pāṇātipātaṃ, adinnādānaṃ, kāmesumicchācāraṃ, musāvādaṃ, surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānaṃ – imāni kho, gahapati, pañca bhayāni verāni pahāya ‘sīlavā’ iti vuccati, sugatiñca upapajjati.

“Householder, by abandoning five fears and enmities, one is called ‘virtuous’ and is reborn in a happy destination. Which five? Taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech, and indulgence in intoxicating drinks and drugs that are a basis for heedlessness. These, householder, are the five fears and enmities by abandoning which one is called ‘virtuous’ and is reborn in a happy destination.”

‘‘Yaṃ, gahapati, pāṇātipātī pāṇātipātapaccayā diṭṭhadhammikampi bhayaṃ veraṃ pasavati, samparāyikampi bhayaṃ veraṃ pasavati, cetasikampi dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti, pāṇātipātā paṭivirato neva diṭṭhadhammikaṃ bhayaṃ veraṃ pasavati, na samparāyikaṃ bhayaṃ veraṃ pasavati, na cetasikaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti. Pāṇātipātā paṭiviratassa evaṃ taṃ bhayaṃ veraṃ vūpasantaṃ hoti.

“Householder, one who takes life generates fear and hostility in this very life because of taking life, generates fear and hostility in the life to come, and experiences mental suffering and displeasure. One who abstains from taking life neither generates fear and hostility in this very life, nor generates fear and hostility in the life to come, nor experiences mental suffering and displeasure. Thus, for one who abstains from taking life, that fear and hostility is stilled.

‘‘Yaṃ, gahapati, adinnādāyī…pe….

“Householder, one who takes what is not given generates fear and hostility in this very life because of taking what is not given, generates fear and hostility in the life to come, and experiences mental suffering and displeasure. One who abstains from taking what is not given neither generates fear and hostility in this very life, nor generates fear and hostility in the life to come, nor experiences mental suffering and displeasure. Thus, for one who abstains from taking what is not given, that fear and hostility is stilled.

‘‘Yaṃ, gahapati, kāmesumicchācārī…pe….

“Householder, one who engages in sexual misconduct generates fear and hostility in this very life because of sexual misconduct, generates fear and hostility in the life to come, and experiences mental suffering and displeasure. One who abstains from sexual misconduct neither generates fear and hostility in this very life, nor generates fear and hostility in the life to come, nor experiences mental suffering and displeasure. Thus, for one who abstains from sexual misconduct, that fear and hostility is stilled.

‘‘Yaṃ, gahapati, musāvādī…pe….

“Householder, one who engages in false speech generates fear and hostility in this very life because of false speech, generates fear and hostility in the life to come, and experiences mental suffering and displeasure. One who abstains from false speech neither generates fear and hostility in this very life, nor generates fear and hostility in the life to come, nor experiences mental suffering and displeasure. Thus, for one who abstains from false speech, that fear and hostility is stilled.

‘‘Yaṃ, gahapati, surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhāyī surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānapaccayā diṭṭhadhammikampi bhayaṃ veraṃ pasavati, samparāyikampi bhayaṃ veraṃ pasavati, cetasikampi dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti, surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā paṭivirato neva diṭṭhadhammikaṃ bhayaṃ veraṃ pasavati, na samparāyikaṃ bhayaṃ veraṃ pasavati, na cetasikaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti. Surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā paṭiviratassa evaṃ taṃ bhayaṃ veraṃ vūpasantaṃ hotī’’ti.

“Householder, one who indulges in intoxicating drinks and drugs that are a basis for heedlessness generates fear and hostility in this very life because of indulging in intoxicating drinks and drugs that are a basis for heedlessness, generates fear and hostility in the life to come, and experiences mental suffering and displeasure. One who abstains from intoxicating drinks and drugs that are a basis for heedlessness neither generates fear and hostility in this very life, nor generates fear and hostility in the life to come, nor experiences mental suffering and displeasure. Thus, for one who abstains from intoxicating drinks and drugs that are a basis for heedlessness, that fear and hostility is stilled.”

‘‘Yo pāṇamatipāteti, musāvādañca bhāsati;Loke adinnaṃ ādiyati, paradārañca gacchati;Surāmerayapānañca, yo naro anuyuñjati.

“One who takes life, and speaks falsehoods; takes what is not given in the world, and goes to another’s wife; and that person who indulges in intoxicating drinks and drugs.

‘‘Appahāya pañca verāni, dussīlo iti vuccati;Kāyassa bhedā duppañño, nirayaṃ sopapajjati.

Without abandoning the five enmities, one is called ‘unvirtuous’; on the dissolution of the body, the unwise one is reborn in hell.

‘‘Yo pāṇaṃ nātipāteti, musāvādaṃ na bhāsati;Loke adinnaṃ nādiyati, paradāraṃ na gacchati;Surāmerayapānañca, yo naro nānuyuñjati.

One who does not take life, nor speaks falsehoods, nor takes what is not given in the world, nor goes to another’s wife, and that person does not indulge in intoxicating drinks and drugs.

‘‘Pahāya pañca verāni, sīlavā iti vuccati;Kāyassa bhedā sappañño, sugatiṃ sopapajjatī’’ti. catutthaṃ;

By abandoning the five enmities, one is called ‘virtuous’; on the dissolution of the body, the wise one is reborn in a happy destination.” That is the fourth.
