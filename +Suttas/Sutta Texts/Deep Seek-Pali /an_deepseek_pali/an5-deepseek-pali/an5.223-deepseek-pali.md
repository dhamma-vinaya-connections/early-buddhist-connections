## AN 5.223 The Discourse on Overstaying

223. ‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, ādīnavā atinivāse. Katame pañca? Bahubhaṇḍo hoti bahubhaṇḍasannicayo, bahubhesajjo hoti bahubhesajjasannicayo, bahukicco hoti bahukaraṇīyo byatto kiṃkaraṇīyesu, saṃsaṭṭho viharati gahaṭṭhapabbajitehi ananulomikena gihisaṃsaggena, tamhā ca āvāsā pakkamanto sāpekkho pakkamati. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca ādīnavā atinivāse.

223."Monks, there are these five drawbacks in overstaying. What five? One has many possessions, an accumulation of many possessions. One has many medicines, an accumulation of many medicines. One has many tasks, with much to be done, and is preoccupied with what needs to be done. One lives entangled with householders and renunciates through unsuitable lay association. And when leaving that dwelling, one departs with attachment. These, monks, are the five drawbacks in overstaying."

‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, ānisaṃsā samavatthavāse. Katame pañca? Na bahubhaṇḍo hoti na bahubhaṇḍasannicayo, na bahubhesajjo hoti na bahubhesajjasannicayo, na bahukicco hoti na bahukaraṇīyo na byatto kiṃkaraṇīyesu, asaṃsaṭṭho viharati gahaṭṭhapabbajitehi ananulomikena gihisaṃsaggena, tamhā ca āvāsā pakkamanto anapekkho pakkamati. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca ānisaṃsā samavatthavāse’’ti. Tatiyaṃ.

"Monks, there are these five benefits of living in a suitable dwelling. What five? One does not have many possessions, nor an accumulation of possessions; one does not have many medicines, nor an accumulation of medicines; one does not have many duties, nor much to do, and is not preoccupied with what needs to be done; one lives unentangled with householders and renunciates, avoiding unsuitable lay association; and when departing from that dwelling, one departs without attachment. These, monks, are the five benefits of living in a suitable dwelling." Third.
