## AN 5.237 The Second Discourse on Those Deserving Dispraise

237. ‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato āvāsiko bhikkhu yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ niraye. Katamehi pañcahi? Ananuvicca apariyogāhetvā avaṇṇārahassa vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati; ananuvicca apariyogāhetvā vaṇṇārahassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati; āvāsamaccharī hoti āvāsapaligedhī; kulamaccharī hoti kulapaligedhī; saddhādeyyaṃ vinipāteti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato āvāsiko bhikkhu yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ niraye.

237."Monks, a resident monk endowed with five qualities is consigned to hell as if brought there. What five? Without having investigated or examined thoroughly, he speaks praise of one who deserves dispraise; without having investigated or examined thoroughly, he speaks dispraise of one who deserves praise; he is stingy about his dwelling and strongly attached to his dwelling; he is stingy about families and strongly attached to families; and he destroys offerings given in faith. A resident monk endowed with these five qualities, monks, is consigned to hell as if brought there."

‘‘Pañcahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato āvāsiko bhikkhu yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ sagge. Katamehi pañcahi? Anuvicca pariyogāhetvā avaṇṇārahassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati; anuvicca pariyogāhetvā vaṇṇārahassa vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati; na āvāsamaccharī hoti na āvāsapaligedhī; na kulamaccharī hoti na kulapaligedhī; saddhādeyyaṃ na vinipāteti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, pañcahi dhammehi samannāgato āvāsiko bhikkhu yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ sagge’’ti. Sattamaṃ.

"Monks, a resident monk endowed with five qualities is consigned to heaven as if brought there. What five? Having investigated or examined thoroughly, he speaks dispraise of one who deserves dispraise; having investigated or examined thoroughly, he speaks praise of one who deserves praise; he is not stingy about his dwelling and not strongly attached to his dwelling; he is not stingy about families and not strongly attached to families; and he does not destroy offerings given in faith. A resident monk endowed with these five qualities, monks, is consigned to heaven as if brought there." This is the seventh.
