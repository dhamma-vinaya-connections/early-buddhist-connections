## AN 5.75 The First Discourse on the Warrior

75. ‘‘Pañcime, bhikkhave, yodhājīvā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ. Katame pañca? Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco yodhājīvo rajaggaññeva disvā saṃsīdati visīdati na santhambhati na sakkoti saṅgāmaṃ otarituṃ. Evarūpopi [evarūpo (sī.) pu. pa. 193], bhikkhave, idhekacco [ekacco (sī.)] yodhājīvo hoti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, paṭhamo yodhājīvo santo saṃvijjamāno lokasmiṃ.

75.“Monks, these five kinds of warriors are found existing in the world. What five? Here, monks, a certain warrior, on seeing just the cloud of dust, loses heart, falters, cannot steady himself, and is unable to plunge into battle. Such a warrior, monks, is found here. This, monks, is the first kind of warrior found existing in the world.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, idhekacco yodhājīvo sahati rajaggaṃ; api ca kho dhajaggaññeva disvā saṃsīdati visīdati, na santhambhati, na sakkoti saṅgāmaṃ otarituṃ. Evarūpopi, bhikkhave, idhekacco yodhājīvo hoti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, dutiyo yodhājīvo santo saṃvijjamāno lokasmiṃ.

“Furthermore, monks, a certain warrior endures the cloud of dust; but on seeing just the banner-top, he loses heart, falters, cannot steady himself, and is unable to plunge into battle. Such a warrior, monks, is found here. This, monks, is the second kind of warrior found existing in the world.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, idhekacco yodhājīvo sahati rajaggaṃ sahati dhajaggaṃ; api ca kho ussāraṇaññeva [ussādanaṃyeva (sī. pī.)] sutvā saṃsīdati visīdati, na santhambhati, na sakkoti saṅgāmaṃ otarituṃ. Evarūpopi, bhikkhave, idhekacco yodhājīvo hoti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, tatiyo yodhājīvo santo saṃvijjamāno lokasmiṃ.

“Furthermore, monks, a certain warrior endures the cloud of dust and the banner-top; but merely on hearing the war cry, he loses heart, falters, cannot steady himself, and is unable to plunge into battle. Such a warrior, monks, is found here. This, monks, is the third kind of warrior found existing in the world.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, idhekacco yodhājīvo sahati rajaggaṃ, sahati dhajaggaṃ, sahati ussāraṇaṃ; api ca kho sampahāre haññati [āhaññati (sī.)] byāpajjati. Evarūpopi, bhikkhave, idhekacco yodhājīvo hoti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, catuttho yodhājīvo santo saṃvijjamāno lokasmiṃ.

“Furthermore, monks, a certain warrior endures the cloud of dust, endures the banner-top, endures the war cry; but in the assault is struck down and perishes. Such a warrior, monks, is found here. This, monks, is the fourth kind of warrior found existing in the world.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, idhekacco yodhājīvo sahati rajaggaṃ, sahati dhajaggaṃ, sahati ussāraṇaṃ, sahati sampahāraṃ. So taṃ saṅgāmaṃ abhivijinitvā vijitasaṅgāmo tameva saṅgāmasīsaṃ ajjhāvasati. Evarūpopi, bhikkhave, idhekacco yodhājīvo hoti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, pañcamo yodhājīvo santo saṃvijjamāno lokasmiṃ. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca yodhājīvā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ.

“Furthermore, monks, a certain warrior endures the cloud of dust, the banner-top, the war cry, and the assault. Having completely conquered that battle, victorious in battle, he remains right there at the head of the battle. Such a warrior, monks, is found here. This, monks, is the fifth kind of warrior found existing in the world. These, monks, are the five kinds of warriors found existing in the world.

‘‘Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, pañcime yodhājīvūpamā puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā bhikkhūsu. Katame pañca? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu rajaggaññeva disvā saṃsīdati visīdati, na santhambhati, na sakkoti brahmacariyaṃ sandhāretuṃ [santānetuṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)]. Sikkhādubbalyaṃ āvikatvā sikkhaṃ paccakkhāya hīnāyāvattati. Kimassa rajaggasmiṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu suṇāti – ‘amukasmiṃ nāma gāme vā nigame vā itthī vā kumārī vā abhirūpā dassanīyā pāsādikā paramāya vaṇṇapokkharatāya samannāgatā’ti. So taṃ sutvā saṃsīdati visīdati, na santhambhati, na sakkoti brahmacariyaṃ sandhāretuṃ. Sikkhādubbalyaṃ āvikatvā sikkhaṃ paccakkhāya hīnāyāvattati. Idamassa rajaggasmiṃ.

“Just so, monks, there are these five kinds of persons comparable to warriors found among the bhikkhus. Which five? Here, monks, a bhikkhu, on seeing what is for him the cloud of dust, loses heart, falters, cannot steady himself, and is unable to maintain the holy life. Having declared his weakness in the training, he abandons the training and returns to the lower life. What is the cloud of dust for him? Here, monks, a bhikkhu hears: ‘In such and such a village or town, there is a woman or a girl who is beautiful, lovely, pleasing, endowed with the highest beauty of complexion.’ Hearing this, he loses heart, falters, cannot steady himself, and is unable to maintain the holy life. Having declared his weakness in the training, he abandons the training and returns to the lower life. This is the cloud of dust for him.

‘‘Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, yodhājīvo rajaggaññeva disvā saṃsīdati visīdati, na santhambhati, na sakkoti saṅgāmaṃ otarituṃ; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi. Evarūpopi, bhikkhave, idhekacco puggalo hoti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, paṭhamo yodhājīvūpamo puggalo santo saṃvijjamāno bhikkhūsu.

“Just as, monks, a warrior, on seeing just the cloud of dust, loses heart, falters, cannot steady himself, and is unable to plunge into battle—so too, monks, I say this person is comparable. Such a person, monks, is found here. This, monks, is the first person comparable to a warrior found existing among the bhikkhus.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sahati rajaggaṃ; api ca kho dhajaggaññeva disvā saṃsīdati visīdati, na santhambhati, na sakkoti brahmacariyaṃ sandhāretuṃ. Sikkhādubbalyaṃ āvikatvā sikkhaṃ paccakkhāya hīnāyāvattati. Kimassa dhajaggasmiṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na heva kho suṇāti – ‘amukasmiṃ nāma gāme vā nigame vā itthī vā kumārī vā abhirūpā dassanīyā pāsādikā paramāya vaṇṇapokkharatāya samannāgatā’ti; api ca kho sāmaṃ passati itthiṃ vā kumāriṃ vā abhirūpaṃ dassanīyaṃ pāsādikaṃ paramāya vaṇṇapokkharatāya samannāgataṃ. So taṃ disvā saṃsīdati visīdati, na santhambhati, na sakkoti brahmacariyaṃ sandhāretuṃ. Sikkhādubbalyaṃ āvikatvā sikkhaṃ paccakkhāya hīnāyāvattati. Idamassa dhajaggasmiṃ.

“Furthermore, monks, a bhikkhu endures the cloud of dust; but on seeing what is for him the banner-top, he loses heart, falters, cannot steady himself, and is unable to maintain the holy life. Having declared his weakness in the training, he abandons the training and returns to the lower life. What is the banner-top for him? Here, monks, a bhikkhu does not merely hear: ‘In such and such a village or town, there is a woman or a girl who is beautiful, lovely, pleasing, endowed with the highest beauty of complexion’; rather, he himself sees a woman or a girl who is beautiful, lovely, pleasing, endowed with the highest beauty of complexion. Upon seeing her, he loses heart, falters, cannot steady himself, and is unable to maintain the holy life. Having declared his weakness in the training, he abandons the training and returns to the lower life. This is the banner-top for him.

‘‘Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, yodhājīvo sahati rajaggaṃ; api ca kho dhajaggaññeva disvā saṃsīdati visīdati, na santhambhati, na sakkoti saṅgāmaṃ otarituṃ; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi. Evarūpopi, bhikkhave, idhekacco puggalo hoti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, dutiyo yodhājīvūpamo puggalo santo saṃvijjamāno bhikkhūsu.

“Just as, monks, a warrior endures the cloud of dust; but on seeing just the banner-top, he loses heart, falters, cannot steady himself, and is unable to plunge into battle—so too, monks, I say this person is comparable. Such a person, monks, is found here. This, monks, is the second person comparable to a warrior found existing among the bhikkhus.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sahati rajaggaṃ, sahati dhajaggaṃ; api ca kho ussāraṇaññeva sutvā saṃsīdati visīdati, na santhambhati, na sakkoti brahmacariyaṃ sandhāretuṃ. Sikkhādubbalyaṃ āvikatvā sikkhaṃ paccakkhāya hīnāyāvattati. Kimassa ussāraṇāya? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhuṃ araññagataṃ vā rukkhamūlagataṃ vā suññāgāragataṃ vā mātugāmo upasaṅkamitvā ūhasati [uhasati (ka.), ohasati (syā. kaṃ.) pu. pa. 196] ullapati ujjagghati uppaṇḍeti. So mātugāmena ūhasiyamāno ullapiyamāno ujjagghiyamāno uppaṇḍiyamāno saṃsīdati visīdati, na santhambhati, na sakkoti brahmacariyaṃ sandhāretuṃ. Sikkhādubbalyaṃ āvikatvā sikkhaṃ paccakkhāya hīnāyāvattati. Idamassa ussāraṇāya.

“Furthermore, monks, a bhikkhu endures the cloud of dust and the banner-top; but merely on hearing what is for him the war cry, he loses heart, falters, cannot steady himself, and is unable to maintain the holy life. Having declared his weakness in the training, he abandons the training and returns to the lower life. What is the war cry for him? Here, monks, a bhikkhu who has gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling is approached by a woman who insinuates, converses, laughs loudly, and mocks him. Being insinuated to, conversed with, laughed loudly at, and mocked by the woman, he loses heart, falters, cannot steady himself, and is unable to maintain the holy life. Having declared his weakness in the training, he abandons the training and returns to the lower life. This is the war cry for him.

‘‘Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, yodhājīvo sahati rajaggaṃ, sahati dhajaggaṃ; api ca kho ussāraṇaññeva sutvā saṃsīdati visīdati, na santhambhati, na sakkoti saṅgāmaṃ otarituṃ; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi. Evarūpopi, bhikkhave, idhekacco puggalo hoti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, tatiyo yodhājīvūpamo puggalo santo saṃvijjamāno bhikkhūsu.

“Just as, monks, a warrior endures the cloud of dust and the banner-top; but merely on hearing the war cry, he loses heart, falters, cannot steady himself, and is unable to plunge into battle—so too, monks, I say this person is comparable. Such a person, monks, is found here. This, monks, is the third person comparable to a warrior found existing among the bhikkhus.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sahati rajaggaṃ, sahati dhajaggaṃ, sahati ussāraṇaṃ; api ca kho sampahāre haññati byāpajjati. Kimassa sampahārasmiṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhuṃ araññagataṃ vā rukkhamūlagataṃ vā suññāgāragataṃ vā mātugāmo upasaṅkamitvā abhinisīdati abhinipajjati ajjhottharati. So mātugāmena abhinisīdiyamāno abhinipajjiyamāno ajjhotthariyamāno sikkhaṃ apaccakkhāya dubbalyaṃ anāvikatvā methunaṃ dhammaṃ paṭisevati. Idamassa sampahārasmiṃ.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endures the dust cloud, endures the banner, endures the uproar; yet he is struck down and perishes in the clash. What is his clash? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who has gone to the wilderness, to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut is approached by a woman who sits close to him, lies down on him, and covers him. When the woman sits close to him, lies down on him, and covers him, he engages in sexual intercourse without renouncing the training or declaring his weakness. This is his clash.

‘‘Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, yodhājīvo sahati rajaggaṃ, sahati dhajaggaṃ, sahati ussāraṇaṃ, api ca kho sampahāre haññati byāpajjati; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi. Evarūpopi, bhikkhave, idhekacco puggalo hoti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, catuttho yodhājīvūpamo puggalo santo saṃvijjamāno bhikkhūsu.

Just as, bhikkhus, that warrior endures the dust cloud, endures the banner, endures the uproar, yet is struck down and perishes in the clash; so too, bhikkhus, I say this person is like that. Such a person, bhikkhus, is found here. This, bhikkhus, is the fourth warrior-like person existing and found among the bhikkhus.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sahati rajaggaṃ, sahati dhajaggaṃ, sahati ussāraṇaṃ, sahati sampahāraṃ, so taṃ saṅgāmaṃ abhivijinitvā vijitasaṅgāmo tameva saṅgāmasīsaṃ ajjhāvasati. Kimassa saṅgāmavijayasmiṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu araññagataṃ vā rukkhamūlagataṃ vā suññāgāragataṃ vā mātugāmo upasaṅkamitvā abhinisīdati abhinipajjati ajjhottharati. So mātugāmena abhinisīdiyamāno abhinipajjiyamāno ajjhotthariyamāno viniveṭhetvā vinimocetvā yena kāmaṃ pakkamati. So vivittaṃ senāsanaṃ bhajati araññaṃ rukkhamūlaṃ pabbataṃ kandaraṃ giriguhaṃ susānaṃ vanapatthaṃ abbhokāsaṃ palālapuñjaṃ.

Furthermore, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endures the dust cloud, endures the banner, endures the uproar, and endures the clash; he conquers that battle, and having conquered the battle, he dwells right at the head of that battle. What is his victory in the clash? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who has gone to the wilderness, to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut is approached by a woman who sits close to him, lies down on him, and covers him. When the woman sits close to him, lies down on him, and covers him, he disentangles himself and frees himself, and departs wherever he wishes. He resorts to a secluded dwelling—the wilderness, the root of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw.

‘‘So araññagato vā rukkhamūlagato vā suññāgāragato vā nisīdati pallaṅkaṃ ābhujitvā ujuṃ kāyaṃ paṇidhāya parimukhaṃ satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā. So abhijjhaṃ loke pahāya vigatābhijjhena cetasā viharati, abhijjhāya cittaṃ parisodheti; byāpādapadosaṃ pahāya abyāpannacitto viharati, sabbapāṇabhūtahitānukampī byāpādapadosā cittaṃ parisodheti; thinamiddhaṃ pahāya vigatathinamiddho viharati ālokasaññī sato sampajāno, thinamiddhā cittaṃ parisodheti; uddhaccakukkuccaṃ pahāya anuddhato viharati ajjhattaṃ vūpasantacitto, uddhaccakukkuccā cittaṃ parisodheti; vicikicchaṃ pahāya tiṇṇavicikiccho viharati akathaṃkathī kusalesu dhammesu, vicikicchāya cittaṃ parisodheti. So ime pañca nīvaraṇe pahāya cetaso upakkilese paññāya dubbalīkaraṇe vivicceva kāmehi…pe… pītiyā ca virāgā upekkhako ca viharati sato sampajāno, sukhañca kāyena paṭisaṃvedeti yaṃ taṃ ariyā ācikkhanti – ‘upekkhako satimā sukhavihārī’ti tatiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati. Sukhassa ca pahānā dukkhassa ca pahānā, pubbeva somanassadomanassānaṃ atthaṅgamā adukkhamasukhaṃ upekkhāsatipārisuddhiṃ catutthaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati.

Having gone to the wilderness, to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, he sits down, having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect, and established mindfulness in front of him. Having abandoned covetousness in the world, he dwells with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind of covetousness. Having abandoned ill will and malevolence, he dwells with a mind free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind of ill will and malevolence. Having abandoned sloth and torpor, he dwells free from sloth and torpor, perceiving light, mindful and clearly comprehending; he purifies his mind of sloth and torpor. Having abandoned restlessness and remorse, he dwells unagitated, with his mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind of restlessness and remorse. Having abandoned doubt, he dwells having overcome doubt, without perplexity about wholesome qualities; he purifies his mind of doubt. So, having abandoned these five hindrances—corruptions of the mind that weaken wisdom—quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion. With the subsiding of thought and examination, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without thought and examination, and has rapture and happiness born of concentration. With the fading away of rapture, he dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending, experiencing happiness with the body; that happiness of which the noble ones declare: ‘Equanimous and mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.’ He enters and dwells in the third jhāna. With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and sorrow, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is neither painful nor pleasant and includes the purity of mindfulness due to equanimity.

‘‘So evaṃ samāhite citte parisuddhe pariyodāte anaṅgaṇe vigatūpakkilese mudubhūte kammaniye ṭhite āneñjappatte āsavānaṃ khayañāṇāya cittaṃ abhininnāmeti. So ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, ‘ayaṃ dukkhasamudayo’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodho’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, ‘ime āsavā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, ‘ayaṃ āsavasamudayo’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, ‘ayaṃ āsavanirodho’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti, ‘ayaṃ āsavanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Tassa evaṃ jānato evaṃ passato kāmāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati, bhavāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati, avijjāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati, vimuttasmiṃ vimuttamiti ñāṇaṃ hoti. ‘Khīṇā jāti, vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ, kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ, nāparaṃ itthattāyā’ti pajānāti. Idamassa saṅgāmavijayasmiṃ.

With his mind thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilements, pliable, workable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the destruction of the taints. He understands as it actually is: ‘This is suffering.’ He understands as it actually is: ‘This is the origin of suffering.’ He understands as it actually is: ‘This is the cessation of suffering.’ He understands as it actually is: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’ He understands as it actually is: ‘These are the taints.’ He understands as it actually is: ‘This is the origin of the taints.’ He understands as it actually is: ‘This is the cessation of the taints.’ He understands as it actually is: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of the taints.’ As he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire, from the taint of existence, and from the taint of ignorance. When liberated, there is the knowledge that he is liberated. He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’ This is his victory in the clash.

‘‘Seyyathāpi so, bhikkhave, yodhājīvo sahati rajaggaṃ, sahati dhajaggaṃ, sahati ussāraṇaṃ, sahati sampahāraṃ, so taṃ saṅgāmaṃ abhivijinitvā vijitasaṅgāmo tameva saṅgāmasīsaṃ ajjhāvasati; tathūpamāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imaṃ puggalaṃ vadāmi. Evarūpopi, bhikkhave, idhekacco puggalo hoti. Ayaṃ, bhikkhave, pañcamo yodhājīvūpamo puggalo santo saṃvijjamāno bhikkhūsu. Ime kho, bhikkhave, pañca yodhājīvūpamā puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā bhikkhūsū’’ti. Pañcamaṃ.

Just as, bhikkhus, that warrior endures the dust cloud, endures the banner, endures the uproar, and endures the clash; he conquers that battle, and having conquered the battle, he dwells right at the head of that battle; so too, bhikkhus, I say this person is like that. Such a person, bhikkhus, is found here. This, bhikkhus, is the fifth warrior-like person existing and found among the bhikkhus. These, bhikkhus, are the five warrior-like persons existing and found among the bhikkhus.” Fifth.
