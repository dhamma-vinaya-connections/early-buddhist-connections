# AN 5.24 Dussīlasuttaṃ

## AN 5.24 The Discourse on the Immoral

24. [a. ni. 5.168; 6.50; 7.65] ‘‘Dussīlassa, bhikkhave, sīlavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti sammāsamādhi; sammāsamādhimhi asati sammāsamādhivipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ; yathābhūtañāṇadassane asati yathābhūtañāṇadassanavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti nibbidāvirāgo; nibbidāvirāge asati nibbidāvirāgavipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, rukkho sākhāpalāsavipanno. Tassa papaṭikāpi na pāripūriṃ gacchati, tacopi na pāripūriṃ gacchati, pheggupi na pāripūriṃ gacchati, sāropi na pāripūriṃ gacchati; evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, dussīlassa sīlavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti sammāsamādhi; sammāsamādhimhi asati sammāsamādhivipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ; yathābhūtañāṇadassane asati yathābhūtañāṇadassanavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti nibbidāvirāgo; nibbidāvirāge asati nibbidāvirāgavipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ.

24.“Monks, for an unvirtuous person, one deficient in virtue, right concentration lacks its foundation. When right concentration is absent, for one deficient in right concentration, the knowledge and vision of things as they really are lacks its foundation. When the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is absent, for one deficient in the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, disenchantment and dispassion lack their foundation. When disenchantment and dispassion are absent, for one deficient in disenchantment and dispassion, the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its foundation. Just as, monks, a tree deficient in branches and foliage—its outer bark does not reach fullness, its inner bark does not reach fullness, its softwood does not reach fullness, its heartwood does not reach fullness—so too, monks, for an unvirtuous person, one deficient in virtue, right concentration lacks its foundation. When right concentration is absent, for one deficient in right concentration, the knowledge and vision of things as they really are lacks its foundation. When the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is absent, for one deficient in the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, disenchantment and dispassion lack their foundation. When disenchantment and dispassion are absent, for one deficient in disenchantment and dispassion, the knowledge and vision of liberation lacks its foundation.”

‘‘Sīlavato, bhikkhave, sīlasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti sammāsamādhi; sammāsamādhimhi sati sammāsamādhisampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ; yathābhūtañāṇadassane sati yathābhūtañāṇadassanasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti nibbidāvirāgo; nibbidāvirāge sati nibbidāvirāgasampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, rukkho sākhāpalāsasampanno. Tassa papaṭikāpi pāripūriṃ gacchati, tacopi pāripūriṃ gacchati, pheggupi pāripūriṃ gacchati, sāropi pāripūriṃ gacchati; evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, sīlavato sīlasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti sammāsamādhi; sammāsamādhimhi sati sammāsamādhisampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ; yathābhūtañāṇadassane sati yathābhūtañāṇadassanasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti nibbidāvirāgo; nibbidāvirāge sati nibbidāvirāgasampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti vimuttiñāṇadassana’’nti. Catutthaṃ.

“Monks, for a virtuous person, one endowed with virtue, right concentration has its foundation complete. When right concentration is present, for one endowed with right concentration, the knowledge and vision of things as they really are has its foundation complete. When the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is present, for one endowed with the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, disenchantment and dispassion have their foundation complete. When disenchantment and dispassion are present, for one endowed with disenchantment and dispassion, the knowledge and vision of liberation has its foundation complete. Just as, monks, a tree complete with branches and foliage—its outer bark reaches fullness, its inner bark reaches fullness, its softwood reaches fullness, and its heartwood reaches fullness—so too, monks, for a virtuous person, one endowed with virtue, right concentration has its foundation complete. When right concentration is present, for one endowed with right concentration, the knowledge and vision of things as they really are has its foundation complete. When the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is present, for one endowed with the knowledge and vision of things as they really are, disenchantment and dispassion have their foundation complete. When disenchantment and dispassion are present, for one endowed with disenchantment and dispassion, the knowledge and vision of liberation has its foundation complete.” Fourth.
