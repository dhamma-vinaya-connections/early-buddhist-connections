## AN 5.7 The Discourse on Sensuality

7. ‘‘Yebhuyyena, bhikkhave, sattā kāmesu laḷitā [palāḷitā (sī.)]. Asitabyābhaṅgiṃ [asitabyābhaṅgi cepi (?)], bhikkhave, kulaputto ohāya agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajito hoti, ‘saddhāpabbajito kulaputto’ti alaṃ vacanāya. Taṃ kissa hetu? Labbhā [labbhā hi (syā.)], bhikkhave, yobbanena kāmā te ca kho yādisā vā tādisā vā. Ye ca, bhikkhave, hīnā kāmā ye ca majjhimā kāmā ye ca paṇītā kāmā, sabbe kāmā ‘kāmā’tveva saṅkhaṃ gacchanti. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, daharo kumāro mando uttānaseyyako dhātiyā pamādamanvāya kaṭṭhaṃ vā kaṭhalaṃ [kathalaṃ (ka.)] vā mukhe āhareyya. Tamenaṃ dhāti sīghaṃ sīghaṃ [sīghasīghaṃ (sī.)] manasi kareyya; sīghaṃ sīghaṃ manasi karitvā sīghaṃ sīghaṃ āhareyya. No ce sakkuṇeyya sīghaṃ sīghaṃ āharituṃ, vāmena hatthena sīsaṃ pariggahetvā dakkhiṇena hatthena vaṅkaṅguliṃ karitvā salohitampi āhareyya. Taṃ kissa hetu? ‘Atthesā, bhikkhave, kumārassa vihesā; nesā natthī’ti vadāmi. Karaṇīyañca kho etaṃ [evaṃ (ka.)], bhikkhave, dhātiyā atthakāmāya hitesiniyā anukampikāya, anukampaṃ upādāya. Yato ca kho, bhikkhave, so kumāro vuddho hoti alaṃpañño, anapekkhā dāni [anapekkhā pana (sī. syā. kaṃ.)], bhikkhave, dhāti tasmiṃ kumāre hoti – ‘attagutto dāni kumāro nālaṃ pamādāyā’ti.

7. ‘‘Most beings, monks, are infatuated with sensual pleasures. A clansman, monks, having abandoned the burden of burdens, has gone forth from the household life into homelessness; it is rightly said of him, ‘This clansman has gone forth out of faith.’ Why is that? Because, monks, sensual pleasures are attainable in youth—and they are of whatever kind they are. Whether inferior, middling, or superior, all sensual pleasures are simply called ‘sensual pleasures.’
‘‘Suppose, monks, a young infant boy, foolish and lying on his back, might, due to the nurse’s negligence, take a stick or a pebble into his mouth. The nurse would quickly attend to him; having quickly attended to him, she would quickly remove it. If she could not remove it quickly, she would hold his head with her left hand and, with a hooked finger of her right hand, pull it out even if it drew blood. Why is that? Because, monks, there is harm for the boy; there is no absence of it, I say. And this, monks, is what must be done by the nurse, desiring his welfare, seeking his good, compassionate, acting out of compassion. However, monks, when that boy grows older and has enough wisdom, the nurse no longer needs to be concerned about him, thinking, ‘Now the boy can guard himself; he is no longer liable to negligence.’’’

‘‘Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, yāvakīvañca bhikkhuno saddhāya akataṃ hoti kusalesu dhammesu, hiriyā akataṃ hoti kusalesu dhammesu, ottappena akataṃ hoti kusalesu dhammesu, vīriyena akataṃ hoti kusalesu dhammesu, paññāya akataṃ hoti kusalesu dhammesu, anurakkhitabbo tāva me so, bhikkhave, bhikkhu hoti. Yato ca kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno saddhāya kataṃ hoti kusalesu dhammesu, hiriyā kataṃ hoti kusalesu dhammesu, ottappena kataṃ hoti kusalesu dhammesu, vīriyena kataṃ hoti kusalesu dhammesu, paññāya kataṃ hoti kusalesu dhammesu, anapekkho dānāhaṃ, bhikkhave [panāhaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ.)], tasmiṃ bhikkhusmiṃ homi – ‘attagutto dāni bhikkhu nālaṃ pamādāyā’’’ti. Sattamaṃ.

"Just so, monks, as long as a monk has not cultivated wholesome qualities through faith, has not cultivated wholesome qualities through conscience, has not cultivated wholesome qualities through fear of wrongdoing, has not cultivated wholesome qualities through energy, has not cultivated wholesome qualities through wisdom—so long, monks, should that monk be guarded by me. But when, monks, a monk has cultivated wholesome qualities through faith, has cultivated wholesome qualities through conscience, has cultivated wholesome qualities through fear of wrongdoing, has cultivated wholesome qualities through energy, has cultivated wholesome qualities through wisdom—then, monks, I am no longer concerned about that monk, thinking: ‘Now the monk is self-guarded, no longer liable to negligence.’" The seventh.
