# AN 5.68 Dutiyaiddhipādasuttaṃ

## AN 5.68 The Second Discourse on the Bases of Spiritual Power

68. ‘‘Pubbevāhaṃ, bhikkhave, sambodhā anabhisambuddho bodhisattova samāno pañca dhamme bhāvesiṃ, pañca dhamme bahulīkāsiṃ [bahulimakāsiṃ (ka.), bahulamakāsiṃ (ka.)]. Katame pañca? Chandasamādhipadhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṃ iddhipādaṃ bhāvesiṃ, vīriyasamādhi… cittasamādhi… vīmaṃsāsamādhipadhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṃ iddhipādaṃ bhāvesiṃ, ussoḷhiññeva pañcamiṃ. So kho ahaṃ, bhikkhave, imesaṃ ussoḷhipañcamānaṃ dhammānaṃ bhāvitattā bahulīkatattā yassa yassa abhiññāsacchikaraṇīyassa dhammassa cittaṃ abhininnāmesiṃ abhiññāsacchikiriyāya, tatra tatreva sakkhibhabbataṃ pāpuṇiṃ sati sati āyatane.

68."Before my full enlightenment, monks, while I was still an unenlightened Bodhisatta, I developed five qualities, I cultivated five qualities. Which five? I developed the base of spiritual power endowed with zeal, concentration, and the volitional formations of striving; I developed the base of spiritual power endowed with energy, concentration, and the volitional formations of striving; I developed the base of spiritual power endowed with mind, concentration, and the volitional formations of striving; I developed the base of spiritual power endowed with investigation, concentration, and the volitional formations of striving; and resoluteness itself as the fifth. It was because I had developed and cultivated these five qualities with resoluteness as the fifth, monks, that whenever I directed my mind to any state realizable by direct knowledge, for the direct realization of it, I attained the capacity to witness it in each and every instance."

‘‘So sace ākaṅkhiṃ – ‘anekavihitaṃ iddhividhaṃ paccanubhaveyyaṃ…pe… yāva brahmalokāpi kāyena vasaṃ vatteyya’nti, tatra tatreva sakkhibhabbataṃ pāpuṇiṃ sati sati āyatane.

"If I wished: ‘I could experience the various kinds of supernormal powers: being one I could become many, being many I could become one; I could appear and vanish; I could pass unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space; I could dive into and emerge from the earth as if it were water; I could walk on water without sinking as if it were earth; I could travel in the sky like a winged bird; I could touch and stroke with my hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; I could exercise bodily mastery even as far as the Brahmā world’—in each and every instance, whenever there is the opportunity, I would attain the ability to realize it."

‘‘So sace ākaṅkhiṃ…pe… ‘āsavānaṃ khayā anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja vihareyya’nti, tatra tatreva sakkhibhabbataṃ pāpuṇiṃ sati sati āyatane’’ti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

"If I wished: ‘By destroying the corruptions, may I realize for myself with direct knowledge and abide in the corruption-free liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, having attained it in this very life,’ then I am capable of realizing it in each and every suitable circumstance." The eighth.
