# AN 10.12 Pañcaṅgasuttaṃ

## AN 10.12 The Five-Factored Discourse

12. ‘‘Pañcaṅgavippahīno, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pañcaṅgasamannāgato imasmiṃ dhammavinaye ‘kevalī vusitavā uttamapuriso’ti vuccati. Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pañcaṅgavippahīno hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno kāmacchando pahīno hoti, byāpādo pahīno hoti, thinamiddhaṃ [thīnamiddhaṃ (sī. syā. pī.)] pahīnaṃ hoti, uddhaccakukkuccaṃ pahīnaṃ hoti, vicikicchā pahīnā hoti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pañcaṅgavippahīno hoti.

12. Monks, a monk who has abandoned five factors and possesses five factors is called in this Dhamma-Vinaya 'one who is complete, who has lived the holy life, a supreme person.' And how, monks, is a monk one who has abandoned five factors? Here, monks, a monk has abandoned sensual desire, ill will, sloth and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. Thus, monks, a monk has abandoned five factors.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pañcaṅgasamannāgato hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu asekhena sīlakkhandhena samannāgato hoti, asekhena samādhikkhandhena samannāgato hoti, asekhena paññākkhandhena samannāgato hoti, asekhena vimuttikkhandhena samannāgato hoti, asekhena vimuttiñāṇadassanakkhandhena samannāgato hoti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pañcaṅgasamannāgato hoti.

"And how, monks, is a monk endowed with five factors? Here, monks, a monk is endowed with the aggregate of virtue of one beyond training, the aggregate of concentration of one beyond training, the aggregate of wisdom of one beyond training, the aggregate of liberation of one beyond training, and the aggregate of knowledge and vision of liberation of one beyond training. Thus, monks, a monk is endowed with five factors."

‘‘Pañcaṅgavippahīno kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pañcaṅgasamannāgato imasmiṃ dhammavinaye ‘kevalī vusitavā uttamapuriso’ti vuccati.

Monks, a monk who has abandoned five factors and possesses five factors is called in this Dhamma-Vinaya 'one who is complete, who has lived the holy life, a supreme person.'

‘‘Kāmacchando ca byāpādo, thinamiddhañca bhikkhuno;Uddhaccaṃ vicikicchā ca, sabbasova na vijjati.

Sensual desire and ill will,
Sloth and drowsiness,
Restlessness and doubt—
Are entirely absent in the monk.

‘‘Asekhena ca sīlena, asekhena samādhinā;Vimuttiyā ca sampanno, ñāṇena ca tathāvidho.

And endowed with virtue beyond training,
With concentration beyond training,
With liberation,
And likewise with knowledge.

‘‘Sa ve pañcaṅgasampanno, pañca aṅge [pañcaṅgāni (syā.)] vivajjayaṃ [vivajjiya (ka.)];Imasmiṃ dhammavinaye, kevalī iti vuccatī’’ti. dutiyaṃ;

He who is endowed with five factors and abandons five factors
is truly called 'the complete one' in this Dhamma-Vinaya.
