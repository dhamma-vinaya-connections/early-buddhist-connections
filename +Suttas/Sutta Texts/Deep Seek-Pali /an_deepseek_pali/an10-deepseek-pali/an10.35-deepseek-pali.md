## AN 10.35 On Dependence

35. ‘‘Katihi nu kho, bhante, dhammehi samannāgatena bhikkhunā nissayo dātabbo’’ti? ‘‘Dasahi kho, upāli, dhammehi samannāgatena bhikkhunā nissayo dātabbo. Katamehi dasahi? Idhupāli, bhikkhu sīlavā hoti…pe… samādāya sikkhati sikkhāpadesu; bahussuto hoti…pe… diṭṭhiyā suppaṭividdhā; pātimokkhaṃ kho panassa vitthārena svāgataṃ hoti suvibhattaṃ suppavattaṃ suvinicchitaṃ suttaso anubyañjanaso; paṭibalo hoti gilānaṃ upaṭṭhātuṃ vā upaṭṭhāpetuṃ vā; paṭibalo hoti anabhiratiṃ vūpakāsetuṃ vā vūpakāsāpetuṃ vā; paṭibalo hoti uppannaṃ kukkuccaṃ dhammato vinodetuṃ; paṭibalo hoti uppannaṃ diṭṭhigataṃ dhammato vivecetuṃ; paṭibalo hoti adhisīle…pe… adhicitte… adhipaññāya samādapetuṃ. Imehi kho, upāli, dasahi dhammehi samannāgatena bhikkhunā nissayo dātabbo’’ti. Pañcamaṃ.

35."Venerable sir, with how many qualities should a bhikkhu be endowed to give dependence?" "Upāli, a bhikkhu should be endowed with ten qualities to give dependence. What ten? Here, Upāli, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the restraint of the Pātimokkha, accomplished in good conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults, and trains himself by undertaking the training rules. He is very learned, a bearer of what he has learned, an accumulator of what he has learned; those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with their meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure holy life—such teachings he has heard much of, retained in mind, familiarized by verbal recitation, mentally scrutinized, and penetrated well by view. Furthermore, the Pātimokkha has been well transmitted to him in detail, is well analyzed, well mastered, and well determined rule by rule and detail by detail. He is capable of attending on a sick person or of getting him attended on. He is capable of dispelling discontent or of getting it dispelled. He is capable of dispelling arisen remorse in accordance with the Dhamma. He is capable of dispelling an arisen wrong view in accordance with the Dhamma. He is capable of encouraging others in the higher virtue, in the higher mind, and in the higher wisdom. Upāli, a bhikkhu endowed with these ten qualities should give dependence." The fifth.
