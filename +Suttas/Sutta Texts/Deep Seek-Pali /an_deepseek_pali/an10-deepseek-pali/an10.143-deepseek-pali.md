143. ‘‘Dukkhudrayañca vo, bhikkhave, dhammaṃ desessāmi sukhudrayañca. Taṃ suṇātha…pe… katamo ca, bhikkhave, dukkhudrayo dhammo? Micchādiṭṭhi…pe… micchāvimutti – ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, dukkhudrayo dhammo. Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sukhudrayo dhammo? Sammādiṭṭhi…pe… sammāvimutti – ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, sukhudrayo dhammo’’ti.

143.“Monks, I will teach you the Dhamma that has suffering as its outcome and the Dhamma that has happiness as its outcome. Listen to it. What, monks, is the Dhamma that has suffering as its outcome? Wrong View…wrong liberation—this is called the Dhamma that has suffering as its outcome. What, monks, is the Dhamma that has happiness as its outcome? Right View…right liberation—this is called the Dhamma that has happiness as its outcome.” Tenth.
