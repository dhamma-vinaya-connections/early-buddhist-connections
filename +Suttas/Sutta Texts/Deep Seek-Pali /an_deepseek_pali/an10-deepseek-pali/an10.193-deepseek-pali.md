# AN 10.193 Saṃsappanīyasuttaṃ

## AN 10.193 The Creeping Discourse

216. ‘‘Saṃsappanīyapariyāyaṃ vo, bhikkhave, dhammapariyāyaṃ desessāmi. Taṃ suṇātha, sādhukaṃ manasi karotha; bhāsissāmī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti kho te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca –

216.“Monks, I will teach you the exposition on creeping. Listen to it, attend closely, I will speak.” “Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One then said this:

‘‘Katamo ca, bhikkhave, saṃsappanīyapariyāyo dhammapariyāyo? Kammassakā, bhikkhave, sattā kammadāyādā kammayonī kammabandhū kammapaṭisaraṇā, yaṃ kammaṃ karonti – kalyāṇaṃ vā pāpakaṃ vā – tassa dāyādā bhavanti.

“And what, monks, is the exposition on creeping? Monks, beings are owners of their kamma, heirs to their kamma, born of their kamma, related by their kamma, and have kamma as their refuge. Whatever kamma they do, whether good or bad, of that they will be the heirs.

‘‘Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco pāṇātipātī hoti luddo lohitapāṇi hatapahate niviṭṭho, adayāpanno sabbapāṇabhūtesu. So saṃsappati kāyena, saṃsappati vācāya, saṃsappati manasā. Tassa jimhaṃ kāyakammaṃ hoti, jimhaṃ vacīkammaṃ, jimhaṃ manokammaṃ, jimhā gati, jimhupapatti.

“Here, monks, some person is a killer of living beings, brutal, bloody-handed, intent on striking and killing, without mercy for all living beings. He creeps with his body, he creeps with his speech, he creeps with his mind. His bodily kamma is crooked, his verbal kamma is crooked, his mental kamma is crooked; his destination is crooked, his rebirth is crooked.

‘‘Jimhagatikassa kho panāhaṃ, bhikkhave, jimhupapattikassa dvinnaṃ gatīnaṃ aññataraṃ gatiṃ vadāmi – ye vā ekantadukkhā nirayā yā vā saṃsappajātikā tiracchānayoni. Katamā ca sā, bhikkhave, saṃsappajātikā tiracchānayoni? Ahi vicchikā satapadī nakulā biḷārā mūsikā ulūkā, ye vā panaññepi keci tiracchānayonikā sattā manusse disvā saṃsappanti. Iti kho, bhikkhave, bhūtā bhūtassa upapatti hoti. Yaṃ karoti tena upapajjati. Upapannamenaṃ phassā phusanti. Evamahaṃ, bhikkhave, ‘kammadāyādā sattā’ti vadāmi.

“Monks, for one whose destination is crooked and whose rebirth is crooked, I declare one of two destinations: either hell, which is exclusively suffering, or the animal realm of creeping creatures. And what, monks, is the animal realm of creeping creatures? Snakes, scorpions, centipedes, mongooses, cats, rats, owls, and whatever other beings of the animal realm creep when they see humans. Thus, monks, a being’s rebirth is according to what has been. By what he does, by that he is reborn. Once reborn, contacts touch him. Thus, monks, I say, ‘Beings are heirs to their kamma.’

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, ekacco adinnādāyī hoti…pe… kāmesumicchācārī hoti… musāvādī hoti… pisuṇavāco hoti… pharusavāco hoti… samphappalāpī hoti… abhijjhālu hoti… byāpannacitto hoti… micchādiṭṭhiko hoti viparītadassano – ‘natthi dinnaṃ…pe… sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedentī’ti. So saṃsappati kāyena, saṃsappati vācāya, saṃsappati manasā. Tassa jimhaṃ kāyakammaṃ hoti, jimhaṃ vacīkammaṃ, jimhaṃ manokammaṃ, jimhā gati, jimhupapatti.

“Here, monks, some person is one who takes what is not given; one who engages in sexual misconduct; one who speaks falsehood; one who speaks divisive speech; one who speaks harsh speech; one who engages in idle chatter; one who is covetous; one who has a mind of ill will; one who holds wrong view, with perverted vision: ‘There is no gift, no sacrifice, no offering; there is no fruit or result of good and bad kamma; there is no this world, no other world; there is no mother, no father; there are no spontaneously arisen beings; there are no recluses and brahmins who are rightly practising, who are rightly attained, who, having directly known and realized for themselves this world and the other world, proclaim it.’ He creeps with his body, he creeps with his speech, he creeps with his mind. His bodily kamma is crooked, his verbal kamma is crooked, his mental kamma is crooked; his destination is crooked, his rebirth is crooked.

‘‘Jimhagatikassa kho panāhaṃ, bhikkhave, jimhupapattikassa dvinnaṃ gatīnaṃ aññataraṃ gatiṃ vadāmi – ye vā ekantadukkhā nirayā yā vā saṃsappajātikā tiracchānayoni. Katamā ca sā, bhikkhave, saṃsappajātikā tiracchānayoni? Ahi vicchikā satapadī nakulā biḷārā mūsikā ulūkā, ye vā panaññepi keci tiracchānayonikā sattā manusse disvā saṃsappanti. Iti kho, bhikkhave, bhūtā bhūtassa upapatti hoti, yaṃ karoti tena upapajjati. Upapannamenaṃ phassā phusanti. Evamahaṃ, bhikkhave, ‘kammadāyādā sattā’ti vadāmi. Kammassakā, bhikkhave, sattā kammadāyādā kammayonī kammabandhū kammapaṭisaraṇā, yaṃ kammaṃ karonti – kalyāṇaṃ vā pāpakaṃ vā – tassa dāyādā bhavanti.

“Monks, for one whose destination is crooked and whose rebirth is crooked, I declare one of two destinations: either hell, which is exclusively suffering, or the animal realm of creeping creatures. And what, monks, is the animal realm of creeping creatures? Snakes, scorpions, centipedes, mongooses, cats, rats, owls, and whatever other beings of the animal realm creep when they see humans. Thus, monks, a being’s rebirth is according to what has been. By what he does, by that he is reborn. Once reborn, contacts touch him. Thus, monks, I say, ‘Beings are heirs to their kamma.’ Monks, beings are owners of their kamma, heirs to their kamma, born of their kamma, related by their kamma, and have kamma as their refuge. Whatever kamma they do, whether good or bad, of that they will be the heirs.

‘‘Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco pāṇātipātaṃ pahāya pāṇātipātā paṭivirato hoti nihitadaṇḍo nihitasattho, lajjī dayāpanno sabbapāṇabhūtahitānukampī viharati. So na saṃsappati kāyena, na saṃsappati vācāya, na saṃsappati manasā. Tassa uju kāyakammaṃ hoti, uju vacīkammaṃ, uju manokammaṃ, uju gati, ujupapatti.

“Here, monks, some person, having abandoned the killing of living beings, abstains from killing living beings. He has laid aside stick and weapon, is conscientious, full of compassion, and dwells for the welfare of all living beings. He does not creep with his body, he does not creep with his speech, he does not creep with his mind. His bodily kamma is straight, his verbal kamma is straight, his mental kamma is straight; his destination is straight, his rebirth is straight.

‘‘Ujugatikassa kho panāhaṃ, bhikkhave, ujupapattikassa dvinnaṃ gatīnaṃ aññataraṃ gatiṃ vadāmi – ye vā ekantasukhā saggā yāni vā pana tāni uccākulāni khattiyamahāsālakulāni vā brāhmaṇamahāsālakulāni vā gahapatimahāsālakulāni vā aḍḍhāni mahaddhanāni mahābhogāni pahūtajātarūparajatāni pahūtavittūpakaraṇāni pahūtadhanadhaññāni. Iti kho, bhikkhave, bhūtā bhūtassa upapatti hoti. Yaṃ karoti tena upapajjati. Upapannamenaṃ phassā phusanti. Evamahaṃ, bhikkhave, ‘kammadāyādā sattā’ti vadāmi.

“Monks, for one whose destination is straight and whose rebirth is straight, I declare one of two destinations: either heaven, which is exclusively blissful, or those high-born families—noble families, brahmin families, or householder families—that are rich, with great wealth and great possessions, abundant in gold and silver, abundant in property and grain. Thus, monks, a being’s rebirth is according to what has been. By what he does, by that he is reborn. Once reborn, contacts touch him. Thus, monks, I say, ‘Beings are heirs to their kamma.’

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, ekacco adinnādānaṃ pahāya adinnādānā paṭivirato hoti…pe… kāmesumicchācārā paṭivirato hoti… musāvādaṃ pahāya musāvādā paṭivirato hoti… pisuṇaṃ vācaṃ pahāya pisuṇāya vācāya paṭivirato hoti… pharusaṃ vācaṃ pahāya pharusāya vācāya paṭivirato hoti… samphappalāpaṃ pahāya samphappalāpā paṭivirato hoti… anabhijjhālu hoti… abyāpannacitto hoti… sammādiṭṭhiko hoti aviparītadassano – ‘atthi dinnaṃ…pe… ye imañca lokaṃ parañca lokaṃ sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedentī’ti. So na saṃsappati kāyena, na saṃsappati vācāya, na saṃsappati manasā. Tassa uju kāyakammaṃ hoti, uju vacīkammaṃ, uju manokammaṃ, uju gati, ujupapatti.

“Here, monks, some person, having abandoned taking what is not given, abstains from taking what is not given; having abandoned sexual misconduct, abstains from sexual misconduct; having abandoned false speech, abstains from false speech; having abandoned divisive speech, abstains from divisive speech; having abandoned harsh speech, abstains from harsh speech; having abandoned idle chatter, abstains from idle chatter; he is uncovetous; he has a mind free of ill will; he holds right view, with unperverted vision: ‘There is what is given, what is sacrificed, what is offered; there is fruit and result of good and bad kamma; there is this world, there is another world; there is mother, there is father; there are spontaneously arisen beings; there are recluses and brahmins who are rightly practising, who are rightly attained, who, having directly known and realized for themselves this world and the other world, proclaim it.’ He does not creep with his body, he does not creep with his speech, he does not creep with his mind. His bodily kamma is straight, his verbal kamma is straight, his mental kamma is straight; his destination is straight, his rebirth is straight.

‘‘Ujugatikassa kho pana ahaṃ, bhikkhave, ujupapattikassa dvinnaṃ gatīnaṃ aññataraṃ gatiṃ vadāmi – ye vā ekantasukhā saggā yāni vā pana tāni uccākulāni khattiyamahāsālakulāni vā brāhmaṇamahāsālakulāni vā gahapatimahāsālakulāni vā aḍḍhāni mahaddhanāni mahābhogāni pahūtajātarūparajatāni pahūtavittūpakaraṇāni pahūtadhanadhaññāni. Iti kho, bhikkhave, bhūtā bhūtassa upapatti hoti. Yaṃ karoti tena upapajjati. Upapannamenaṃ phassā phusanti. Evamahaṃ, bhikkhave, ‘kammadāyādā sattā’ti vadāmi.

‘‘Kammassakā, bhikkhave, sattā kammadāyādā kammayonī kammabandhū kammapaṭisaraṇā, yaṃ kammaṃ karonti – kalyāṇaṃ vā pāpakaṃ vā – tassa dāyādā bhavanti. Ayaṃ kho so, bhikkhave, saṃsappanīyapariyāyo dhammapariyāyo’’ti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

“Monks, beings are owners of their kamma, heirs to their kamma, born of their kamma, related by their kamma, and have kamma as their refuge. Whatever kamma they do, whether good or bad, of that they will be the heirs. This, monks, is the exposition on creeping.” Sixth.
