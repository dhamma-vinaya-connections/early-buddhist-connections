## AN 10.3 The Discourse on the First Dependence

3. [a. ni. 5.24; 11.3] ‘‘Dussīlassa, bhikkhave, sīlavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti avippaṭisāro; avippaṭisāre asati avippaṭisāravipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti pāmojjaṃ; pāmojje asati pāmojjavipannassa hatūpanisā hoti pīti; pītiyā asati pītivipannassa hatūpanisā hoti passaddhi; passaddhiyā asati passaddhivipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti sukhaṃ; sukhe asati sukhavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti sammāsamādhi; sammāsamādhimhi asati sammāsamādhivipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ; yathābhūtañāṇadassane asati yathābhūtañāṇadassanavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti nibbidāvirāgo; nibbidāvirāge asati nibbidāvirāgavipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, rukkho sākhāpalāsavipanno. Tassa papaṭikāpi na pāripūriṃ gacchati, tacopi… pheggupi… sāropi na pāripūriṃ gacchati. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, dussīlassa sīlavipannassa hatūpaniso hoti avippaṭisāro; avippaṭisāre asati avippaṭisāravipannassa hatūpanisaṃ hoti…pe… vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ.

3. For an unvirtuous person, mendicants, one whose virtue is corrupted, non-remorse is destroyed. When there is no non-remorse, for one corrupted in non-remorse, joy is destroyed. When there is no joy, for one corrupted in joy, rapture is destroyed. When there is no rapture, for one corrupted in rapture, tranquility is destroyed. When there is no tranquility, for one corrupted in tranquility, happiness is destroyed. When there is no happiness, for one corrupted in happiness, right concentration is destroyed. When there is no right concentration, for one corrupted in right concentration, knowledge and vision of things as they really are is destroyed. When there is no knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one corrupted in knowledge and vision of things as they really are, disillusionment and dispassion are destroyed. When there is no disillusionment and dispassion, for one corrupted in disillusionment and dispassion, the knowledge and vision of freedom is destroyed. Just as, mendicants, a tree whose branches and leaves are ruined: its outer bark doesn’t develop fully, nor its inner bark, nor its softwood, nor its heartwood. In the same way, mendicants, for an unvirtuous person whose virtue is corrupted, non-remorse is destroyed … the knowledge and vision of freedom is destroyed.

‘‘Sīlavato, bhikkhave, sīlasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti avippaṭisāro; avippaṭisāre sati avippaṭisārasampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti pāmojjaṃ; pāmojje sati pāmojjasampannassa upanisasampannā hoti pīti; pītiyā sati pītisampannassa upanisasampannā hoti passaddhi; passaddhiyā sati passaddhisampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti sukhaṃ; sukhe sati sukhasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti sammāsamādhi; sammāsamādhimhi sati sammāsamādhisampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ; yathābhūtañāṇadassane sati yathābhūtañāṇadassanasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti nibbidāvirāgo; nibbidāvirāge sati nibbidāvirāgasampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, rukkho sākhāpalāsasampanno. Tassa papaṭikāpi pāripūriṃ gacchati, tacopi… pheggupi… sāropi pāripūriṃ gacchati. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, sīlavato sīlasampannassa upanisasampanno hoti avippaṭisāro; avippaṭisāre sati avippaṭisārasampannassa upanisasampannaṃ hoti…pe… vimuttiñāṇadassana’’nti. Tatiyaṃ.

For a virtuous person, mendicants, one whose virtue is accomplished, non-remorse comes to be complete, having its condition. When there is non-remorse, for one accomplished in non-remorse, joy comes to be complete, having its condition. When there is joy, for one accomplished in joy, rapture comes to be complete, having its condition. When there is rapture, for one accomplished in rapture, tranquility comes to be complete, having its condition. When there is tranquility, for one accomplished in tranquility, happiness comes to be complete, having its condition. When there is happiness, for one accomplished in happiness, right concentration comes to be complete, having its condition. When there is right concentration, for one accomplished in right concentration, knowledge and vision of things as they really are comes to be complete, having its condition. When there is knowledge and vision of things as they really are, for one accomplished in knowledge and vision of things as they really are, disillusionment and dispassion comes to be complete, having its condition. When there is disillusionment and dispassion, for one accomplished in disillusionment and dispassion, the knowledge and vision of freedom comes to be complete, having its condition. Just as, mendicants, a tree whose branches and leaves are perfect: its outer bark also develops fully, its inner bark also develops fully, its softwood also develops fully, its heartwood also develops fully. In the same way, mendicants, for a virtuous person whose virtue is accomplished, non-remorse comes to be complete, having its condition... the knowledge and vision of freedom comes to be complete, having its condition. This is the third.
