## AN 10.59 The Going Forth

59. ‘‘Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, evaṃ sikkhitabbaṃ – ‘yathāpabbajjāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, na cuppannā pāpakā akusalā dhammā cittaṃ pariyādāya ṭhassanti; aniccasaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, anattasaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, asubhasaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, ādīnavasaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, lokassa samañca visamañca ñatvā taṃsaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, lokassa bhavañca [sambhavañca (sī. syā.)] vibhavañca ñatvā taṃsaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, lokassa samudayañca atthaṅgamañca ñatvā taṃsaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, pahānasaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, virāgasaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissati, nirodhasaññāparicitañca no cittaṃ bhavissatī’ti – evañhi vo, bhikkhave, sikkhitabbaṃ.

59."Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘Our minds will be familiar with what is in accordance with the going forth, and evil unwholesome states that have arisen will not persist obsessing our minds. Our minds will be familiar with the perception of impermanence, with the perception of not-self, with the perception of unattractiveness, with the perception of drawback. Having known the world’s evenness and unevenness, our minds will be familiar with the perception of that. Having known the world’s becoming and non-becoming, our minds will be familiar with the perception of that. Having known the world’s origination and passing away, our minds will be familiar with the perception of that. Our minds will be familiar with the perception of abandoning, with the perception of dispassion, with the perception of cessation.’ This, bhikkhus, is how you should train yourselves.

‘‘Yato kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno yathāpabbajjāparicitañca cittaṃ hoti na cuppannā pāpakā akusalā dhammā cittaṃ pariyādāya tiṭṭhanti, aniccasaññāparicitañca cittaṃ hoti, anattasaññāparicitañca cittaṃ hoti, asubhasaññāparicitañca cittaṃ hoti, ādīnavasaññāparicitañca cittaṃ hoti, lokassa samañca visamañca ñatvā taṃsaññāparicitañca cittaṃ hoti, lokassa bhavañca vibhavañca ñatvā taṃsaññāparicitañca cittaṃ hoti, lokassa samudayañca atthaṅgamañca ñatvā taṃsaññāparicitañca cittaṃ hoti, pahānasaññāparicitañca cittaṃ hoti, virāgasaññāparicitañca cittaṃ hoti, nirodhasaññāparicitañca cittaṃ hoti, tassa dvinnaṃ phalānaṃ aññataraṃ phalaṃ pāṭikaṅkhaṃ – diṭṭheva dhamme aññā, sati vā upādisese anāgāmitā’’ti. Navamaṃ.

"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu's mind is familiar with what is in accordance with the going forth, and evil unwholesome states that have arisen do not persist obsessing his mind; when his mind is familiar with the perception of impermanence, with the perception of not-self, with the perception of unattractiveness, with the perception of drawback; when, having known the world’s evenness and unevenness, his mind is familiar with the perception of that; when, having known the world’s becoming and non-becoming, his mind is familiar with the perception of that; when, having known the world’s origination and passing away, his mind is familiar with the perception of that; when his mind is familiar with the perception of abandoning, with the perception of dispassion, with the perception of cessation—one of two fruits is to be expected for him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue of clinging, non-returning." Ninth.
