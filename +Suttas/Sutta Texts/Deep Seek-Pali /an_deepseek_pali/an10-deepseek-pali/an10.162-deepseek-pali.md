## AN 10.162 The Third Discourse on What Is Not Dhamma

173. ‘‘Adhammo ca, bhikkhave, veditabbo dhammo ca; anattho ca veditabbo attho ca. Adhammañca viditvā dhammañca, anatthañca viditvā atthañca yathā dhammo yathā attho tathā paṭipajjitabbaṃ.

173.“Monks, what is not Dhamma should be understood, and what is Dhamma should be understood; what is unbeneficial should be understood, and what is beneficial should be understood. Having understood what is not Dhamma and what is Dhamma, what is unbeneficial and what is beneficial, one should practice in accordance with Dhamma and what is beneficial.”

‘‘Katamo ca, bhikkhave, adhammo, katamo ca dhammo; katamo ca anattho, katamo ca attho? Pāṇātipāto, bhikkhave, adhammo; pāṇātipātā veramaṇī dhammo; ye ca pāṇātipātapaccayā aneke pāpakā akusalā dhammā sambhavanti, ayaṃ anattho; pāṇātipātā veramaṇipaccayā ca aneke kusalā dhammā bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchanti, ayaṃ attho.

“And what, monks, is what is not Dhamma, and what is Dhamma? What is unbeneficial, and what is beneficial? The destruction of life, monks, is what is not Dhamma. Abstaining from the destruction of life is Dhamma. And the many evil, unwholesome states that arise conditioned by the destruction of life: this is what is unbeneficial. And the many wholesome states that go to the perfection of development conditioned by abstaining from the destruction of life: this is what is beneficial.”

‘‘Adinnādānaṃ, bhikkhave, adhammo; adinnādānā veramaṇī dhammo… kāmesumicchācāro, bhikkhave, adhammo; kāmesumicchācārā veramaṇī dhammo… musāvādo, bhikkhave, adhammo; musāvādā veramaṇī dhammo… pisuṇā vācā, bhikkhave, adhammo; pisuṇāya vācāya veramaṇī dhammo… pharusā vācā, bhikkhave, adhammo; pharusāya vācāya veramaṇī dhammo… samphappalāpo, bhikkhave, adhammo; samphappalāpā veramaṇī dhammo… abhijjhā, bhikkhave, adhammo; anabhijjhā dhammo… byāpādo, bhikkhave, adhammo; abyāpādo dhammo….

“Taking what is not given, monks, is what is not Dhamma; abstaining from taking what is not given is Dhamma. Sexual misconduct, monks, is what is not Dhamma; abstaining from sexual misconduct is Dhamma. False speech, monks, is what is not Dhamma; abstaining from false speech is Dhamma. Slanderous speech, monks, is what is not Dhamma; abstaining from slanderous speech is Dhamma. Harsh speech, monks, is what is not Dhamma; abstaining from harsh speech is Dhamma. Idle chatter, monks, is what is not Dhamma; abstaining from idle chatter is Dhamma. Covetousness, monks, is what is not Dhamma; non-covetousness is Dhamma. Ill will, monks, is what is not Dhamma; absence of ill will is Dhamma.”

‘‘Micchādiṭṭhi, bhikkhave, adhammo; sammādiṭṭhi dhammo; ye ca micchādiṭṭhipaccayā aneke pāpakā akusalā dhammā sambhavanti, ayaṃ anattho; sammādiṭṭhipaccayā ca aneke kusalā dhammā bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchanti, ayaṃ attho.

“Wrong view, monks, is what is not Dhamma; right view is Dhamma. The many evil, unwholesome states that arise conditioned by wrong view: this is what is unbeneficial. The many wholesome states that go to the perfection of development conditioned by right view: this is what is beneficial.”

‘‘‘Adhammo ca, bhikkhave, veditabbo dhammo ca; anattho ca veditabbo attho ca. Adhammañca viditvā dhammañca, anatthañca viditvā atthañca yathā dhammo yathā attho tathā paṭipajjitabba’nti, iti yaṃ taṃ vuttaṃ, idametaṃ paṭicca vutta’’nti. Sattamaṃ.

“‘Monks, what is not Dhamma should be understood, and what is Dhamma should be understood; what is unbeneficial should be understood, and what is beneficial should be understood. Having understood what is not Dhamma and what is Dhamma, what is unbeneficial and what is beneficial, one should practice in accordance with Dhamma and what is beneficial.’ Thus was it said, and it was in reference to this that it was said.” The seventh.
