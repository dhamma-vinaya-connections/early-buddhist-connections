# AN 10.2 Cetanākaraṇīyasuttaṃ

## AN 10.2 The Discourse on What Should Be Done by Intention

2. [a. ni. 11.2] ‘‘Sīlavato, bhikkhave, sīlasampannassa na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘avippaṭisāro me uppajjatū’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ sīlavato sīlasampannassa avippaṭisāro uppajjati. Avippaṭisārissa, bhikkhave, na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘pāmojjaṃ me uppajjatū’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ avippaṭisārissa pāmojjaṃ jāyati. Pamuditassa, bhikkhave, na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘pīti me uppajjatū’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ pamuditassa pīti uppajjati. Pītimanassa, bhikkhave, na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘kāyo me passambhatū’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ pītimanassa kāyo passambhati. Passaddhakāyassa, bhikkhave, na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘sukhaṃ vediyāmī’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ passaddhakāyo sukhaṃ vediyati. Sukhino, bhikkhave, na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘cittaṃ me samādhiyatū’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ sukhino cittaṃ samādhiyati. Samāhitassa, bhikkhave, na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘yathābhūtaṃ jānāmi passāmī’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ samāhito yathābhūtaṃ jānāti passati. Yathābhūtaṃ, bhikkhave, jānato passato na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘nibbindāmi virajjāmī’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ yathābhūtaṃ jānaṃ passaṃ nibbindati virajjati. Nibbinnassa [nibbindassa (sī. ka.)], bhikkhave, virattassa na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ – ‘vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ sacchikaromī’ti. Dhammatā esā, bhikkhave, yaṃ nibbinno [nibbindo (sī. ka.)] viratto vimuttiñāṇadassanaṃ sacchikaroti.

2. "Monks, for one who is virtuous, accomplished in virtue, there is no need to intend: ‘May freedom from remorse arise in me.’ It is natural, monks, that freedom from remorse arises in one who is virtuous, accomplished in virtue. For one free from remorse, monks, there is no need to intend: ‘May gladness arise in me.’ It is natural, monks, that gladness arises in one who is free from remorse. For one who is gladdened, monks, there is no need to intend: ‘May rapture arise in me.’ It is natural, monks, that rapture arises in one who is gladdened. For one who is rapturous, monks, there is no need to intend: ‘May my body become tranquil.’ It is natural, monks, that the body of one who is rapturous becomes tranquil. For one whose body is tranquil, monks, there is no need to intend: ‘May I experience happiness.’ It is natural, monks, that one whose body is tranquil experiences happiness. For one who is happy, monks, there is no need to intend: ‘May my mind become concentrated.’ It is natural, monks, that the mind of one who is happy becomes concentrated. For one who is concentrated, monks, there is no need to intend: ‘May I know and see things as they actually are.’ It is natural, monks, that one who is concentrated knows and sees things as they actually are. For one who knows and sees things as they actually are, monks, there is no need to intend: ‘May I become disenchanted and dispassionate.’ It is natural, monks, that one who knows and sees things as they actually are becomes disenchanted and dispassionate. For one who is disenchanted and dispassionate, monks, there is no need to intend: ‘May I realize the knowledge and vision of liberation.’ It is natural, monks, that one who is disenchanted and dispassionate realizes the knowledge and vision of liberation."

‘‘Iti kho, bhikkhave, nibbidāvirāgo vimuttiñāṇadassanattho vimuttiñāṇadassanānisaṃso; yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ nibbidāvirāgatthaṃ nibbidāvirāgānisaṃsaṃ; samādhi yathābhūtañāṇadassanattho yathābhūtañāṇadassanānisaṃso; sukhaṃ samādhatthaṃ samādhānisaṃsaṃ; passaddhi sukhatthā sukhānisaṃsā; pīti passaddhatthā passaddhānisaṃsā; pāmojjaṃ pītatthaṃ pītānisaṃsaṃ; avippaṭisāro pāmojjattho pāmojjānisaṃso; kusalāni sīlāni avippaṭisāratthāni avippaṭisārānisaṃsāni. Iti kho, bhikkhave, dhammā dhamme abhisandenti, dhammā dhamme paripūrenti apārā pāraṃ gamanāyā’’ti. Dutiyaṃ.

"Thus, monks, disenchantment and dispassion have the knowledge and vision of liberation as their purpose, the knowledge and vision of liberation as their benefit. Knowledge and vision of things as they really are have disenchantment and dispassion as their purpose, disenchantment and dispassion as their benefit. Concentration has the knowledge and vision of things as they really are as its purpose, the knowledge and vision of things as they really are as its benefit. Happiness has concentration as its purpose, concentration as its benefit. Tranquility has happiness as its purpose, happiness as its benefit. Rapture has tranquility as its purpose, tranquility as its benefit. Gladness has rapture as its purpose, rapture as its benefit. Freedom from remorse has gladness as its purpose, gladness as its benefit. Wholesome moral conduct has freedom from remorse as its purpose, freedom from remorse as its benefit. Thus, monks, these qualities flow into one another, these qualities fulfill one another for going from this shore to the far shore."
