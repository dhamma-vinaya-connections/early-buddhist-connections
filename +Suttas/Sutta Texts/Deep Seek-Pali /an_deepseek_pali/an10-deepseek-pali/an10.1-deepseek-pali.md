# AN 10.1 Kimatthiyasuttaṃ

## AN 10.1 The Discourse on What Purpose

1. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Atha kho āyasmā ānando yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā ānando bhagavantaṃ etadavoca –

1. Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. Then the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One:

‘‘Kimatthiyāni, bhante, kusalāni sīlāni kimānisaṃsānī’’ti? ‘‘Avippaṭisāratthāni kho, ānanda, kusalāni sīlāni avippaṭisārānisaṃsānī’’ti.

"For what purpose, Bhante, are wholesome states of morality, and what is their benefit?" "Wholesome states of morality, Ananda, have as their purpose freedom from remorse, and as their benefit freedom from remorse."

‘‘Avippaṭisāro pana, bhante, kimatthiyo kimānisaṃso’’ti? ‘‘Avippaṭisāro kho, ānanda, pāmojjattho pāmojjānisaṃso’’ti [pāmujjattho pāmujjānisaṃsoti (sī. syā. pī.) a. ni. 11.1].

"But what is the purpose and benefit of freedom from remorse, Bhante?" "Freedom from remorse, Ananda, has gladness as its purpose and as its benefit."

‘‘Pāmojjaṃ pana, bhante, kimatthiyaṃ kimānisaṃsa’’nti? ‘‘Pāmojjaṃ kho, ānanda, pītatthaṃ pītānisaṃsa’’nti.

"What purpose, Bhante, does gladness have, and what is its benefit?" "Gladness, Ananda, has joy as its purpose and its benefit."

‘‘Pīti pana, bhante, kimatthiyā kimānisaṃsā’’ti? ‘‘Pīti kho, ānanda, passaddhatthā passaddhānisaṃsā’’ti.

"But for what purpose, Bhante, is rapture? What is its benefit?" "Rapture, Ananda, has serenity as its purpose, and serenity as its benefit."

‘‘Passaddhi pana, bhante, kimatthiyā kimānisaṃsā’’ti? ‘‘Passaddhi kho, ānanda, sukhatthā sukhānisaṃsā’’ti.

"But for what purpose, Bhante, is serenity? What is its benefit?" "Serenity, Ananda, has happiness as its purpose, and happiness as its benefit."

‘‘Sukhaṃ pana, bhante, kimatthiyaṃ kimānisaṃsa’’nti? ‘‘Sukhaṃ kho, ānanda, samādhatthaṃ samādhānisaṃsa’’nti.

"But for what purpose, Bhante, is happiness, and what is its benefit?" "Happiness, Ananda, has concentration as its purpose, and concentration as its benefit."

‘‘Samādhi pana, bhante, kimatthiyo kimānisaṃso’’ti? ‘‘Samādhi kho, ānanda, yathābhūtañāṇadassanattho yathābhūtañāṇadassanānisaṃso’’ti.

"But for what purpose, Bhante, is concentration, and what is its benefit?" "Concentration, Ananda, has knowledge and vision of things as they really are as its purpose, and knowledge and vision of things as they really are as its benefit."

‘‘Yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ pana, bhante, kimatthiyaṃ kimānisaṃsa’’nti? ‘‘Yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ kho, ānanda, nibbidāvirāgatthaṃ nibbidāvirāgānisaṃsa’’nti.

"But for what purpose, Bhante, is knowledge and vision of things as they really are, and what is its benefit?" "Knowledge and vision of things as they really are, Ananda, has disenchantment and dispassion as its purpose and benefit."

‘‘Nibbidāvirāgo pana, bhante kimatthiyo kimānisaṃso’’ti? ‘‘Nibbidāvirāgo kho, ānanda, vimuttiñāṇadassanattho vimuttiñāṇadassanānisaṃso [… nisaṃsoti (sī. ka.)].

"But for what purpose, Bhante, is disenchantment and dispassion, and what is its benefit?" "Disenchantment and dispassion, Ananda, has knowledge and vision of liberation as its purpose, and knowledge and vision of liberation as its benefit."

‘‘Iti kho, ānanda, kusalāni sīlāni avippaṭisāratthāni avippaṭisārānisaṃsāni; avippaṭisāro pāmojjattho pāmojjānisaṃso; pāmojjaṃ pītatthaṃ pītānisaṃsaṃ; pīti passaddhatthā passaddhānisaṃsā; passaddhi sukhatthā sukhānisaṃsā; sukhaṃ samādhatthaṃ samādhānisaṃsaṃ; samādhi yathābhūtañāṇadassanattho yathābhūtañāṇadassanānisaṃso; yathābhūtañāṇadassanaṃ nibbidāvirāgatthaṃ nibbidāvirāgānisaṃsaṃ; nibbidāvirāgo vimuttiñāṇadassanattho vimuttiñāṇadassanānisaṃso. Iti kho, ānanda, kusalāni sīlāni anupubbena aggāya parentī’’ti [arahattāya pūrentīti (syā.)]. Paṭhamaṃ.

"Thus, Ānanda, wholesome virtues have non-remorse as their purpose and non-remorse as their benefit; non-remorse has joy as its purpose and joy as its benefit; joy has rapture as its purpose and rapture as its benefit; rapture has serenity as its purpose and serenity as its benefit; serenity has happiness as its purpose and happiness as its benefit; happiness has concentration as its purpose and concentration as its benefit; concentration has knowledge and vision of things as they really are as its purpose and knowledge and vision of things as they really are as its benefit; knowledge and vision of things as they really are has disenchantment and dispassion as its purpose and disenchantment and dispassion as its benefit; disenchantment and dispassion has knowledge and vision of liberation as its purpose and knowledge and vision of liberation as its benefit. Thus, Ānanda, wholesome virtues lead step by step to the highest."
