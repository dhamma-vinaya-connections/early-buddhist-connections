# AN 10.80 Āghātapaṭivinayasuttaṃ

## AN 10.80 Subduing Resentment

80. ‘‘Dasayime, bhikkhave, āghātapaṭivinayā. Katame dasa? ‘Anatthaṃ me acari, taṃ kutettha labbhā’ti āghātaṃ paṭivineti, ‘anatthaṃ me carati, taṃ kutettha labbhā’ti āghātaṃ paṭivineti, ‘anatthaṃ me carissati, taṃ kutettha labbhā’ti āghātaṃ paṭivineti, piyassa me manāpassa anatthaṃ acari…pe… carati…pe… carissati, taṃ kutettha labbhāti āghātaṃ paṭivineti, appiyassa me amanāpassa atthaṃ acari…pe… atthaṃ carati…pe… atthaṃ carissati, taṃ kutettha labbhāti āghātaṃ paṭivineti, aṭṭhāne ca na kuppati – ime kho, bhikkhave, dasa āghātapaṭivinayā’’ti. Dasamaṃ.

80.“Bhikkhus, there are these ten ways of subduing resentment. What ten? ‘He has done me harm, but what is to be gained from that?’—thus one subdues resentment. ‘He is doing me harm, but what is to be gained from that?’—thus one subdues resentment. ‘He will do me harm, but what is to be gained from that?’—thus one subdues resentment. ‘He has done harm to a person dear and pleasing to me, but what is to be gained from that?’—thus one subdues resentment. ‘He is doing harm to a person dear and pleasing to me, but what is to be gained from that?’—thus one subdues resentment. ‘He will do harm to a person dear and pleasing to me, but what is to be gained from that?’—thus one subdues resentment. ‘He has benefited a person not dear or pleasing to me, but what is to be gained from that?’—thus one subdues resentment. ‘He is benefiting a person not dear or pleasing to me, but what is to be gained from that?’—thus one subdues resentment. ‘He will benefit a person not dear or pleasing to me, but what is to be gained from that?’—thus one subdues resentment. And one does not get angry without cause. These, bhikkhus, are the ten ways of subduing resentment.” The tenth.
