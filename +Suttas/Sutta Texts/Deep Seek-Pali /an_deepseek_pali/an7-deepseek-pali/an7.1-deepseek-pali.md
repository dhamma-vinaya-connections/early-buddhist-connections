# AN 7.1 Paṭhamapiyasuttaṃ

## AN 7.1 The First Discourse on Affection

1. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘bhikkhavo’’ti. ‘‘Bhadante’’ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca –

1. Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!" "Venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

‘‘Sattahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu sabrahmacārīnaṃ appiyo ca hoti amanāpo ca agaru ca abhāvanīyo ca. Katamehi sattahi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu lābhakāmo ca hoti, sakkārakāmo ca hoti, anavaññattikāmo ca hoti, ahiriko ca hoti, anottappī ca, pāpiccho ca, micchādiṭṭhi ca. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, sattahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu sabrahmacārīnaṃ appiyo ca hoti amanāpo ca agaru ca abhāvanīyo ca.

“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endowed with seven qualities is displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks, and is neither respected nor esteemed. What seven? Here, a bhikkhu is desirous of gains, desirous of honor, desirous of not being despised, shameless, lacking moral dread, with evil desires, and holding wrong view. Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endowed with these seven qualities is displeasing and disagreeable to his fellow monks, and is neither respected nor esteemed.

‘‘Sattahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu sabrahmacārīnaṃ piyo ca hoti, manāpo ca garu ca bhāvanīyo ca. Katamehi sattahi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na lābhakāmo ca hoti, na sakkārakāmo ca hoti, na anavaññattikāmo ca hoti, hirimā ca hoti, ottappī ca, appiccho ca, sammādiṭṭhi ca. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, sattahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu sabrahmacārīnaṃ piyo ca hoti manāpo ca garu ca bhāvanīyo cā’’ti. Paṭhamaṃ.

“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endowed with seven qualities is dear and agreeable to his fellow monks, and is respected and esteemed. What seven? Here, a bhikkhu is not desirous of gains, not desirous of honor, not desirous of non-denigration, has shame, has moral dread, has few desires, and has right view. Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endowed with these seven qualities is dear and agreeable to his fellow monks, and is respected and esteemed.” The first.
