## AN 7.70 The Respectful Discourse

70. Atha kho āyasmato sāriputtassa rahogatassa paṭisallīnassa evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘‘kiṃ nu kho, bhikkhu, sakkatvā garuṃ katvā upanissāya viharanto akusalaṃ pajaheyya, kusalaṃ bhāveyyā’’ti? Atha kho āyasmato sāriputtassa etadahosi – ‘‘satthāraṃ kho, bhikkhu, sakkatvā garuṃ katvā upanissāya viharanto akusalaṃ pajaheyya, kusalaṃ bhāveyya. Dhammaṃ kho, bhikkhu…pe… saṅghaṃ kho, bhikkhu…pe… sikkhaṃ kho, bhikkhu…pe… samādhiṃ kho, bhikkhu…pe… appamādaṃ kho, bhikkhu…pe… paṭisanthāraṃ kho, bhikkhu sakkatvā garuṃ katvā upanissāya viharanto akusalaṃ pajaheyya, kusalaṃ bhāveyyā’’ti.

70.Then, while the Venerable Sāriputta was alone in seclusion, this thought arose in his mind: "What, indeed, should a bhikkhu respect and honor, rely upon, and live accordingly, so as to abandon the unwholesome and develop the wholesome?" Then the Venerable Sāriputta thought: "A bhikkhu should respect and honor, rely upon, and live accordingly with the Teacher, so as to abandon the unwholesome and develop the wholesome. A bhikkhu should respect and honor, rely upon, and live accordingly with the Dhamma… the Saṅgha… the training… concentration… heedfulness… cordiality, so as to abandon the unwholesome and develop the wholesome."

Atha kho āyasmato sāriputtassa etadahosi – ‘‘ime kho me dhammā parisuddhā pariyodātā, yaṃnūnāhaṃ ime dhamme gantvā [gahetvā (ka.)] bhagavato āroceyyaṃ. Evaṃ me ime dhammā parisuddhā ceva bhavissanti parisuddhasaṅkhātatarā ca. Seyyathāpi nāma puriso suvaṇṇanikkhaṃ adhigaccheyya parisuddhaṃ pariyodātaṃ. Tassa evamassa – ‘ayaṃ kho me suvaṇṇanikkho parisuddho pariyodāto, yaṃnūnāhaṃ imaṃ suvaṇṇanikkhaṃ gantvā [gahetvā (ka.)] kammārānaṃ dasseyyaṃ. Evaṃ me ayaṃ suvaṇṇanikkho sakammāragato parisuddho ceva bhavissati parisuddhasaṅkhātataro ca. Evamevaṃ [kho (ka.)] me ime dhammā parisuddhā pariyodātā, yaṃnūnāhaṃ ime dhamme gantvā [gahetvā (ka.)] bhagavato āroceyyaṃ. Evaṃ me ime dhammā parisuddhā ceva bhavissanti parisuddhasaṅkhātatarā cā’’’ti.

Then Venerable Sāriputta thought: "These qualities are purified and clarified for me. Suppose I were to go and report these qualities to the Blessed One. In this way, these qualities will be purified and considered all the more purified for me. Just as if a man were to obtain a gold coin that is purified and clarified. He might think: 'This gold coin is purified and clarified. Suppose I were to go and show this gold coin to goldsmiths. In this way, this gold coin, having reached the goldsmiths, will be purified and considered all the more purified for me.' In the same way, these qualities are purified and clarified for me. Suppose I were to go and report these qualities to the Blessed One. In this way, these qualities will be purified and considered all the more purified for me."

Atha kho āyasmā sāriputto sāyanhasamayaṃ paṭisallānā vuṭṭhito yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā sāriputto bhagavantaṃ etadavoca –

Then, in the evening, Venerable Sāriputta rose from seclusion and approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, Venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One:

‘‘Idha mayhaṃ, bhante, rahogatassa paṭisallīnassa evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘kiṃ nu kho, bhikkhu, sakkatvā garuṃ katvā upanissāya viharanto akusalaṃ pajaheyya, kusalaṃ bhāveyyā’ti? Atha kho tassa mayhaṃ, bhante, etadahosi – ‘satthāraṃ kho, bhikkhu, sakkatvā garuṃ katvā upanissāya viharanto akusalaṃ pajaheyya, kusalaṃ bhāveyya. Dhammaṃ kho, bhikkhu …pe… paṭisanthāraṃ kho, bhikkhu sakkatvā…pe… kusalaṃ bhāveyyā’ti. Atha kho tassa mayhaṃ, bhante, etadahosi – ‘ime kho me dhammā parisuddhā pariyodātā, yaṃnūnāhaṃ ime dhamme gantvā bhagavato āroceyyaṃ. Evaṃ me ime dhammā parisuddhā ceva bhavissanti parisuddhasaṅkhātatarā ca. Seyyathāpi nāma puriso suvaṇṇanikkhaṃ adhigaccheyya parisuddhaṃ pariyodātaṃ. Tassa evamassa – ayaṃ kho me suvaṇṇanikkho parisuddho pariyodāto, yaṃnūnāhaṃ imaṃ suvaṇṇanikkhaṃ gantvā kammārānaṃ dasseyyaṃ. Evaṃ me ayaṃ suvaṇṇanikkho sakammāragato parisuddho ceva bhavissati parisuddhasaṅkhātataro ca. Evamevaṃ me ime dhammā parisuddhā pariyodātā, yaṃnūnāhaṃ ime dhamme gantvā bhagavato āroceyyaṃ. Evaṃ me ime dhammā parisuddhā ceva bhavissanti parisuddhasaṅkhātatarā cā’’’ti.

"Just now, venerable sir, while I was in seclusion, withdrawn, this consideration arose in my mind: ‘What, indeed, should a bhikkhu honor, respect, and rely upon in order to abandon the unwholesome and develop the wholesome?’ Then, venerable sir, it occurred to me: ‘A bhikkhu should honor, respect, and rely upon the Teacher in order to abandon the unwholesome and develop the wholesome. A bhikkhu should honor, respect, and rely upon the Dhamma… the Saṅgha… the training… concentration… heedfulness… cordiality in order to abandon the unwholesome and develop the wholesome.’ Then, venerable sir, it occurred to me: ‘These qualities of mine are purified and clarified. Suppose I were to go and report these qualities to the Blessed One. In this way, these qualities of mine will both be purified and be considered all the more purified. Just as if a man were to obtain a gold coin, purified and clarified. He might think: “This gold coin of mine is purified and clarified. Suppose I were to go and show this gold coin to goldsmiths. In this way, this gold coin of mine, having reached the goldsmiths, will both be purified and be considered all the more purified.” In the same way, these qualities of mine are purified and clarified. Suppose I were to go and report these qualities to the Blessed One. In this way, these qualities of mine will both be purified and be considered all the more purified.’"

‘‘Sādhu sādhu, sāriputta! Satthāraṃ kho, sāriputta, bhikkhu sakkatvā garuṃ katvā upanissāya viharanto akusalaṃ pajaheyya, kusalaṃ bhāveyya. Dhammaṃ kho, sāriputta, bhikkhu sakkatvā garuṃ katvā upanissāya viharanto akusalaṃ pajaheyya, kusalaṃ bhāveyya. Saṅghaṃ kho…pe… sikkhaṃ kho… samādhiṃ kho… appamādaṃ kho… paṭisanthāraṃ kho, sāriputta, bhikkhu sakkatvā garuṃ katvā upanissāya viharanto akusalaṃ pajaheyya, kusalaṃ bhāveyyā’’ti.

"Good, good, Sāriputta! A monk who honors, respects, and relies upon the Teacher would abandon the unwholesome and develop the wholesome. A monk who honors, respects, and relies upon the Dhamma… the Saṅgha… the training… concentration… heedfulness… cordiality would abandon the unwholesome and develop the wholesome."

Evaṃ vutte āyasmā sāriputto bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘imassa kho ahaṃ, bhante, bhagavatā saṃkhittena bhāsitassa evaṃ vitthārena atthaṃ ājānāmi. So vata, bhante, bhikkhu satthari agāravo dhamme sagāravo bhavissatīti netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati. Yo so, bhante, bhikkhu satthari agāravo dhammepi so agāravo’’.

When this was said, Venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One: "I understand the meaning of this brief statement spoken by the Blessed One thus in detail. It is impossible, venerable sir, that a monk disrespectful to the Teacher will be respectful to the Dhamma. That monk, venerable sir, who is disrespectful to the Teacher is also disrespectful to the Dhamma."

‘‘So vata, bhante, bhikkhu satthari agāravo dhamme agāravo saṅghe sagāravo bhavissatīti netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati. Yo so, bhante, bhikkhu satthari agāravo dhamme agāravo saṅghepi so agāravo.

"Indeed, venerable sir, it is not possible that a monk who is disrespectful to the Teacher and the Dhamma will be respectful to the Saṅgha. That monk, venerable sir, who is disrespectful to the Teacher and the Dhamma is also disrespectful to the Saṅgha."

‘‘So vata, bhante, bhikkhu satthari agāravo dhamme agāravo saṅghe agāravo sikkhāya sagāravo bhavissatīti netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati. Yo so, bhante, bhikkhu satthari agāravo dhamme agāravo saṅghe agāravo sikkhāyapi so agāravo.

"Indeed, venerable sir, it is impossible that a monk who is disrespectful toward the Teacher, disrespectful toward the Dhamma, disrespectful toward the Saṅgha, will be respectful toward the training.

‘‘So vata, bhante, bhikkhu satthari agāravo dhamme agāravo saṅghe agāravo sikkhāya agāravo samādhismiṃ agāravo appamāde sagāravo bhavissatīti netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati. Yo so, bhante, bhikkhu satthari agāravo dhamme agāravo saṅghe agāravo sikkhāya agāravo samādhismiṃ agāravo appamādepi so agāravo.

"Indeed, venerable sir, it is impossible that a monk who is disrespectful towards the Teacher, disrespectful towards the Dhamma, disrespectful towards the Saṅgha, disrespectful towards the training, and disrespectful towards concentration, will be respectful towards heedfulness. That monk, venerable sir, who is disrespectful towards the Teacher, disrespectful towards the Dhamma, disrespectful towards the Saṅgha, disrespectful towards the training, and disrespectful towards concentration, is also disrespectful towards heedfulness."

‘‘So vata, bhante, bhikkhu satthari agāravo dhamme agāravo saṅghe agāravo sikkhāya agāravo samādhismiṃ agāravo appamāde agāravo paṭisanthāre sagāravo bhavissatīti netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati. Yo so, bhante, bhikkhu satthari agāravo…pe… appamāde agāravo paṭisanthārepi so agāravo.

"Indeed, venerable sir, it is impossible that a monk who is disrespectful towards the Teacher, disrespectful towards the Dhamma, disrespectful towards the Saṅgha, disrespectful towards the training, disrespectful towards concentration, and disrespectful towards heedfulness, will be respectful towards cordiality.

"Venerable sir, it is impossible that a monk who is respectful towards the Teacher will be disrespectful towards the Dhamma. That monk, venerable sir, who is respectful towards the Teacher is also respectful towards the Dhamma…"

‘‘So vata, bhante, bhikkhu satthari sagāravo…pe. … appamāde sagāravo paṭisanthāre agāravo bhavissatīti netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati. Yo so, bhante, bhikkhu satthari sagāravo…pe… appamāde sagāravo paṭisanthārepi so sagāravo.

‘‘Imassa kho ahaṃ, bhante, bhagavatā saṃkhittena bhāsitassa evaṃ vitthārena atthaṃ ājānāmī’’ti.

"Venerable sir, I understand the meaning of this brief statement spoken by the Blessed One thus in detail."

‘‘Sādhu sādhu, sāriputta! Sādhu kho tvaṃ, sāriputta, imassa mayā saṃkhittena bhāsitassa evaṃ vitthārena atthaṃ ājānāsi. So vata, sāriputta, bhikkhu satthari agāravo dhamme sagāravo bhavissatīti netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati…pe… yo so, sāriputta, bhikkhu satthari agāravo dhamme agāravo saṅghe agāravo sikkhāya agāravo samādhismiṃ agāravo appamādepi so agāravo.

“Good, good, Sāriputta! It is good, Sāriputta, that you understand in such detail the meaning of what I have spoken briefly. It is not possible, Sāriputta, that a bhikkhu who is disrespectful toward the Teacher will be respectful toward the Dhamma… That bhikkhu, Sāriputta, who is disrespectful toward the Teacher, disrespectful toward the Dhamma, disrespectful toward the Saṅgha, disrespectful toward the training, disrespectful toward concentration, is also disrespectful toward heedfulness.
