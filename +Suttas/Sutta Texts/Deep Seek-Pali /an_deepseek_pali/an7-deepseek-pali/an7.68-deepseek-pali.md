## AN 7.68 The Discourse on the Knower of the Dhamma

68. ‘‘Sattahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu āhuneyyo hoti …pe… anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassa. Katamehi sattahi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu dhammaññū ca hoti atthaññū ca attaññū ca mattaññū ca kālaññū ca parisaññū ca puggalaparoparaññū ca.

68.Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endowed with seven qualities is worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of gifts, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What seven? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is a knower of the Dhamma, a knower of the meaning, a knower of himself, a knower of moderation, a knower of the proper time, a knower of assemblies, and a knower of individuals, superior and inferior.

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu dhammaññū hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu dhammaṃ jānāti – suttaṃ geyyaṃ veyyākaraṇaṃ gāthaṃ udānaṃ itivuttakaṃ jātakaṃ abbhutadhammaṃ vedallaṃ. No ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhu dhammaṃ jāneyya – suttaṃ geyyaṃ…pe… abbhutadhammaṃ vedallaṃ, nayidha ‘dhammaññū’ti vucceyya. Yasmā ca kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu dhammaṃ jānāti – suttaṃ geyyaṃ…pe… abbhutadhammaṃ vedallaṃ, tasmā ‘dhammaññū’ti vuccati. Iti dhammaññū.

And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu a knower of the Dhamma? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows the Dhamma—the suttas, mixed prose and verse, explanations, verses, inspired utterances, thus-saids, birth stories, amazing things, and analyses. If, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu did not know the Dhamma—the suttas, mixed prose and verse, explanations, verses, inspired utterances, thus-saids, birth stories, amazing things, and analyses—he would not be called here ‘a knower of the Dhamma.’ But because, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows the Dhamma—the suttas, mixed prose and verse, explanations, verses, inspired utterances, thus-saids, birth stories, amazing things, and analyses—therefore he is called ‘a knower of the Dhamma.’ Thus, he is a knower of the Dhamma.

‘‘Atthaññū ca kathaṃ hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu tassa tasseva bhāsitassa atthaṃ jānāti – ‘ayaṃ imassa bhāsitassa attho, ayaṃ imassa bhāsitassa attho’ti. No ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhu tassa tasseva bhāsitassa atthaṃ jāneyya – ‘ayaṃ imassa bhāsitassa attho, ayaṃ imassa bhāsitassa attho’ti, nayidha ‘atthaññū’ti vucceyya. Yasmā ca kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu tassa tasseva bhāsitassa atthaṃ jānāti – ‘ayaṃ imassa bhāsitassa attho, ayaṃ imassa bhāsitassa attho’ti, tasmā ‘atthaññū’ti vuccati. Iti dhammaññū, atthaññū.

And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu a knower of the meaning? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows the meaning of each and every statement spoken: ‘This is the meaning of this statement, this is the meaning of that statement.’ If, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu did not know the meaning of each and every statement spoken: ‘This is the meaning of this statement, this is the meaning of that statement,’ he would not be called here ‘a knower of the meaning.’ But because, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows the meaning of each and every statement spoken: ‘This is the meaning of this statement, this is the meaning of that statement,’ therefore he is called ‘a knower of the meaning.’ Thus, he is a knower of the Dhamma and a knower of the meaning.

‘‘Attaññū ca kathaṃ hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu attānaṃ jānāti – ‘ettakomhi saddhāya sīlena sutena cāgena paññāya paṭibhānenā’ti. No ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhu attānaṃ jāneyya – ‘ettakomhi saddhāya sīlena sutena cāgena paññāya paṭibhānenā’ti, nayidha ‘attaññū’ti vucceyya. Yasmā ca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu attānaṃ jānāti – ‘ettakomhi saddhāya sīlena sutena cāgena paññāya paṭibhānenā’ti, tasmā ‘attaññū’ti vuccati. Iti dhammaññū, atthaññū, attaññū.

And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu a knower of himself? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows himself: ‘I am thus far in faith, in virtue, in learning, in relinquishment, in wisdom, and in eloquence.’ If, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu did not know himself: ‘I am thus far in faith, in virtue, in learning, in relinquishment, in wisdom, and in eloquence,’ he would not be called here ‘a knower of himself.’ But because, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows himself: ‘I am thus far in faith, in virtue, in learning, in relinquishment, in wisdom, and in eloquence,’ therefore he is called ‘a knower of himself.’ Thus, he is a knower of the Dhamma, a knower of the meaning, and a knower of himself.

‘‘Mattaññū ca kathaṃ hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu mattaṃ jānāti cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhārānaṃ paṭiggahaṇāya. No ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhu mattaṃ jāneyya cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhārānaṃ paṭiggahaṇāya, nayidha ‘mattaññū’ti vucceyya. Yasmā ca kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu mattaṃ jānāti cīvarapiṇḍapātasenāsanagilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhārānaṃ paṭiggahaṇāya, tasmā ‘mattaññū’ti vuccati. Iti dhammaññū, atthaññū, attaññū, mattaññū.

And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu a knower of moderation? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows moderation in accepting robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites. If, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu did not know moderation in accepting robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites, he would not be called here ‘a knower of moderation.’ But because, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows moderation in accepting robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites, therefore he is called ‘a knower of moderation.’ Thus, he is a knower of the Dhamma, a knower of the meaning, a knower of himself, and a knower of moderation.

‘‘Kālaññū ca kathaṃ hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu, kālaṃ jānāti – ‘ayaṃ kālo uddesassa, ayaṃ kālo paripucchāya, ayaṃ kālo yogassa, ayaṃ kālo paṭisallānassā’ti. No ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kālaṃ jāneyya – ‘ayaṃ kālo uddesassa, ayaṃ kālo paripucchāya, ayaṃ kālo yogassa, ayaṃ kālo paṭisallānassā’ti, nayidha ‘kālaññū’ti vucceyya. Yasmā ca kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kālaṃ jānāti – ‘ayaṃ kālo uddesassa, ayaṃ kālo paripucchāya, ayaṃ kālo yogassa, ayaṃ kālo paṭisallānassā’ti, tasmā ‘kālaññū’ti vuccati. Iti dhammaññū, atthaññū, attaññū, mattaññū, kālaññū.

And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu a knower of the proper time? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows the time: ‘This is the time for learning, this is the time for questioning, this is the time for striving, this is the time for seclusion.’ If, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu did not know the time: ‘This is the time for learning, this is the time for questioning, this is the time for striving, this is the time for seclusion,’ he would not be called here ‘a knower of the proper time.’ But because, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows the time: ‘This is the time for learning, this is the time for questioning, this is the time for striving, this is the time for seclusion,’ therefore he is called ‘a knower of the proper time.’ Thus, he is a knower of the Dhamma, a knower of the meaning, a knower of himself, a knower of moderation, and a knower of the proper time.

‘‘Parisaññū ca kathaṃ hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu parisaṃ jānāti – ‘ayaṃ khattiyaparisā, ayaṃ brāhmaṇaparisā, ayaṃ gahapatiparisā, ayaṃ samaṇaparisā. Tattha evaṃ upasaṅkamitabbaṃ, evaṃ ṭhātabbaṃ, evaṃ kattabbaṃ, evaṃ nisīditabbaṃ, evaṃ bhāsitabbaṃ, evaṃ tuṇhī bhavitabba’nti. No ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhu parisaṃ jāneyya – ‘ayaṃ khattiyaparisā…pe… evaṃ tuṇhī bhavitabba’nti, nayidha ‘parisaññū’ti vucceyya. Yasmā ca kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu parisaṃ jānāti – ‘ayaṃ khattiyaparisā, ayaṃ brāhmaṇaparisā, ayaṃ gahapatiparisā, ayaṃ samaṇaparisā. Tattha evaṃ upasaṅkamitabbaṃ, evaṃ ṭhātabbaṃ, evaṃ kattabbaṃ, evaṃ nisīditabbaṃ, evaṃ bhāsitabbaṃ, evaṃ tuṇhī bhavitabba’nti, tasmā ‘parisaññū’ti vuccati. Iti dhammaññū, atthaññū, attaññū, mattaññū, kālaññū, parisaññū.

And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu a knower of assemblies? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows an assembly: ‘This is an assembly of nobles, this is an assembly of brahmins, this is an assembly of householders, this is an assembly of ascetics. There, one should approach thus, stand thus, act thus, sit thus, speak thus, and remain silent thus.’ If, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu did not know an assembly: ‘This is an assembly of nobles, this is an assembly of brahmins, this is an assembly of householders, this is an assembly of ascetics. There, one should approach thus, stand thus, act thus, sit thus, speak thus, and remain silent thus,’ he would not be called here ‘a knower of assemblies.’ But because, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows an assembly: ‘This is an assembly of nobles, this is an assembly of brahmins, this is an assembly of householders, this is an assembly of ascetics. There, one should approach thus, stand thus, act thus, sit thus, speak thus, and remain silent thus,’ therefore he is called ‘a knower of assemblies.’ Thus, he is a knower of the Dhamma, a knower of the meaning, a knower of himself, a knower of moderation, a knower of the proper time, and a knower of assemblies.

‘‘Puggalaparoparaññū ca kathaṃ hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno [sabbatthapi idha ārambhe ‘‘bhikkhuno’’ tveva dissati] dvayena puggalā viditā honti. Dve puggalā – eko ariyānaṃ dassanakāmo, eko ariyānaṃ na dassanakāmo. Yvāyaṃ puggalo ariyānaṃ na dassanakāmo, evaṃ so tenaṅgena gārayho. Yvāyaṃ puggalo ariyānaṃ dassanakāmo, evaṃ so tenaṅgena pāsaṃso.

And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu one who knows individuals, superior and inferior? Here, bhikkhus, individuals are known to a bhikkhu by two means. There are two kinds of individuals: one who desires to see the noble ones, and one who does not desire to see the noble ones. That individual who does not desire to see the noble ones is blameworthy in that respect. That individual who desires to see the noble ones is praiseworthy in that respect.

‘‘Dve puggalā ariyānaṃ dassanakāmā – eko saddhammaṃ sotukāmo, eko saddhammaṃ na sotukāmo. Yvāyaṃ puggalo saddhammaṃ na sotukāmo, evaṃ so tenaṅgena gārayho. Yvāyaṃ puggalo saddhammaṃ sotukāmo, evaṃ so tenaṅgena pāsaṃso.

Among those two kinds of individuals who desire to see the noble ones, there are two kinds: one who wishes to hear the true Dhamma, and one who does not wish to hear the true Dhamma. That individual who does not wish to hear the true Dhamma is blameworthy in that respect. That individual who wishes to hear the true Dhamma is praiseworthy in that respect.

‘‘Dve puggalā saddhammaṃ sotukāmā – eko ohitasoto dhammaṃ suṇāti, eko anohitasoto dhammaṃ suṇāti. Yvāyaṃ puggalo anohitasoto dhammaṃ suṇāti, evaṃ so tenaṅgena gārayho. Yvāyaṃ puggalo ohitasoto dhammaṃ suṇāti, evaṃ so tenaṅgena pāsaṃso.

Among those two kinds of individuals who wish to hear the true Dhamma, there are two kinds: one listens to the Dhamma with attentive ears, the other listens to the Dhamma with inattentive ears. That individual who listens to the Dhamma with inattentive ears is blameworthy in that respect. That individual who listens to the Dhamma with attentive ears is praiseworthy in that respect.

‘‘Dve puggalā ohitasotā dhammaṃ suṇanti [suṇantā (ka.)] – eko sutvā dhammaṃ dhāreti, eko sutvā dhammaṃ na dhāreti. Yvāyaṃ puggalo sutvā na dhammaṃ dhāreti, evaṃ so tenaṅgena gārayho. Yvāyaṃ puggalo sutvā dhammaṃ dhāreti, evaṃ so tenaṅgena pāsaṃso.

Among those two kinds of individuals who listen to the Dhamma with attentive ears, there are two kinds: one retains the Dhamma after hearing it, the other does not retain the Dhamma after hearing it. That individual who does not retain the Dhamma after hearing it is blameworthy in that respect. That individual who retains the Dhamma after hearing it is praiseworthy in that respect.

‘‘Dve puggalā sutvā dhammaṃ dhārenti [dhārentā (ka.)] – eko dhātānaṃ [dhatānaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] dhammānaṃ atthaṃ upaparikkhati, eko dhātānaṃ dhammānaṃ atthaṃ na upaparikkhati. Yvāyaṃ puggalo dhātānaṃ dhammānaṃ atthaṃ na upaparikkhati, evaṃ so tenaṅgena gārayho. Yvāyaṃ puggalo dhātānaṃ dhammānaṃ atthaṃ upaparikkhati, evaṃ so tenaṅgena pāsaṃso.

Among those two kinds of individuals who retain the Dhamma after hearing it, there are two kinds: one examines the meaning of the teachings they have retained, and the other does not examine the meaning of the teachings they have retained. That individual who does not examine the meaning of the teachings they have retained is blameworthy in that respect. That individual who examines the meaning of the teachings they have retained is praiseworthy in that respect.

‘‘Dve puggalā dhātānaṃ dhammānaṃ atthaṃ upaparikkhanti [upaparikkhantā (ka.)] – eko atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya dhammānudhammappaṭipanno, eko atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya na dhammānudhammappaṭipanno. Yvāyaṃ puggalo atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya na dhammānudhammappaṭipanno, evaṃ so tenaṅgena gārayho. Yvāyaṃ puggalo atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya dhammānudhammappaṭipanno, evaṃ so tenaṅgena pāsaṃso.

Among those two kinds of individuals who examine the meaning of the teachings they have retained, there are two kinds: one who, having understood the meaning and the Dhamma, practices in accordance with the Dhamma and its sub-teachings; the other who, having understood the meaning and the Dhamma, does not practice in accordance with the Dhamma and its sub-teachings. That individual who, having understood the meaning and the Dhamma, does not practice in accordance with the Dhamma and its sub-teachings is blameworthy in that respect. That individual who, having understood the meaning and the Dhamma, practices in accordance with the Dhamma and its sub-teachings is praiseworthy in that respect.

‘‘Dve puggalā atthamaññāya dhammamaññāya dhammānudhammappaṭipannā – eko attahitāya paṭipanno no parahitāya, eko attahitāya ca paṭipanno parahitāya ca. Yvāyaṃ puggalo attahitāya paṭipanno no parahitāya, evaṃ so tenaṅgena gārayho. Yvāyaṃ puggalo atthahitāya ca paṭipanno parahitāya ca, evaṃ so tenaṅgena pāsaṃso. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno [bhikkhunā (sī. syā.)] dvayena puggalā viditā honti. Evaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu puggalaparoparaññū hoti. ‘‘Imehi kho, bhikkhave, sattahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu āhuneyyo hoti pāhuneyyo…pe… anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassā’’ti. Catutthaṃ.

"Two persons, having understood the meaning and the Dhamma, practice in accordance with the Dhamma—one practices for his own benefit but not for the benefit of others, and one practices for both his own benefit and the benefit of others. The person who practices for his own benefit but not for the benefit of others is blameworthy in that respect. The person who practices for both his own benefit and the benefit of others is praiseworthy in that respect. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu knows persons in two ways. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu is one who knows the superior and inferior qualities of persons." "Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu endowed with these seven qualities is worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality... an unsurpassed field of merit for the world." This was the fourth.
