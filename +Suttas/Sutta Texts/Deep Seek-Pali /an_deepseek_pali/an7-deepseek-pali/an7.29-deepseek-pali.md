# AN 7.29 Dutiyaparihānisuttaṃ

## AN 7.29 The Second Discourse on Decline

29. ‘‘Sattime, bhikkhave, dhammā upāsakassa parihānāya saṃvattanti. Katame satta? Bhikkhudassanaṃ hāpeti, saddhammassavanaṃ pamajjati, adhisīle na sikkhati, appasādabahulo hoti, bhikkhūsu theresu ceva navesu ca majjhimesu ca upārambhacitto dhammaṃ suṇāti randhagavesī, ito bahiddhā dakkhiṇeyyaṃ gavesati, tattha ca pubbakāraṃ karoti. Ime kho, bhikkhave, satta dhammā upāsakassa parihānāya saṃvattanti.

29.“Bhikkhus, there are these seven qualities that lead to the decline of a lay follower. What seven? He neglects visiting the bhikkhus; he is negligent in listening to the true Dhamma; he does not train in the higher virtue; he is largely without confidence; he listens to the Dhamma with a mind intent on finding fault with the bhikkhus—whether they are elders, newly ordained, or of middle standing—seeking their flaws; he seeks outside this Dispensation for those worthy of offerings; and he makes his offerings there first. These, bhikkhus, are the seven qualities that lead to the decline of a lay follower.

‘‘Sattime, bhikkhave, dhammā upāsakassa aparihānāya saṃvattanti. Katame satta? Bhikkhudassanaṃ na hāpeti, saddhammassavanaṃ nappamajjati, adhisīle sikkhati, pasādabahulo hoti, bhikkhūsu theresu ceva navesu ca majjhimesu ca anupārambhacitto dhammaṃ suṇāti na randhagavesī, na ito bahiddhā dakkhiṇeyyaṃ gavesati, idha ca pubbakāraṃ karoti. Ime kho, bhikkhave, satta dhammā upāsakassa aparihānāya saṃvattantī’’ti. Idamavoca bhagavā. Idaṃ vatvāna sugato athāparaṃ etadavoca satthā –

“Bhikkhus, there are these seven qualities that lead to the non-decline of a lay follower. What seven? He does not neglect visiting the bhikkhus; he is not negligent in listening to the true Dhamma; he trains in the higher virtue; he is abundant in confidence; he listens to the Dhamma with a mind free from disparagement towards the bhikkhus—whether they are elders, newly ordained, or of middle standing—not seeking their flaws; he does not seek outside this Dispensation for those worthy of offerings; and he makes his offerings here first. These, bhikkhus, are the seven qualities that lead to the non-decline of a lay follower.” This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:

‘‘Dassanaṃ bhāvitattānaṃ, yo hāpeti upāsako;Savanañca ariyadhammānaṃ, adhisīle na sikkhati.

The lay follower who neglects visiting those whose minds are cultivated, and neglects listening to the noble Dhamma, and does not train in the higher virtue;

‘‘Appasādo ca bhikkhūsu, bhiyyo bhiyyo pavaḍḍhati;Upārambhakacitto ca, saddhammaṃ sotumicchati.

His lack of confidence in the bhikkhus grows ever greater; and with a mind intent on finding fault, he desires to hear the true Dhamma.

‘‘Ito ca bahiddhā aññaṃ, dakkhiṇeyyaṃ gavesati;Tattheva ca pubbakāraṃ, yo karoti upāsako.

And seeks outside this (Dispensation) for others worthy of offerings, the lay follower who makes his offerings there first.

‘‘Ete kho parihāniye, satta dhamme sudesite;Upāsako sevamāno, saddhammā parihāyati.

These seven qualities of decline, well taught, a lay follower who cultivates them declines from the true Dhamma.

‘‘Dassanaṃ bhāvitattānaṃ, yo na hāpeti upāsako;Savanañca ariyadhammānaṃ, adhisīle ca sikkhati.

The lay follower who does not neglect visiting those whose minds are cultivated, and does not neglect listening to the noble Dhamma, and trains in the higher virtue;

‘‘Pasādo cassa bhikkhūsu, bhiyyo bhiyyo pavaḍḍhati;Anupārambhacitto ca, saddhammaṃ sotumicchati.

His confidence in the bhikkhus grows ever greater; and with a mind free from disparagement, he desires to hear the true Dhamma.

‘‘Na ito bahiddhā aññaṃ, dakkhiṇeyyaṃ gavesati;Idheva ca pubbakāraṃ, yo karoti upāsako.

Does not seek outside this (Dispensation) for others worthy of offerings, the lay follower who makes his offerings here first.

‘‘Ete kho aparihāniye, satta dhamme sudesite;Upāsako sevamāno, saddhammā na parihāyatī’’ti. navamaṃ;

These seven qualities of non-decline, well taught, a lay follower who cultivates them does not decline from the true Dhamma.” This is the ninth.
