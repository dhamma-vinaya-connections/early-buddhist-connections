## AN 7.60 The Sutta on Seven Qualities

60. ‘‘Sattahi, bhikkhave, dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu nacirasseva āsavānaṃ khayā…pe… sacchikatvā upasampajja vihareyya. Katamehi sattahi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu saddho hoti, sīlavā hoti, bahussuto hoti, paṭisallīno hoti, āraddhavīriyo hoti, satimā hoti, paññavā hoti. Imehi kho, bhikkhave, sattahi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu nacirasseva āsavānaṃ khayā…pe… sacchikatvā upasampajja vihareyyā’’ti. Sattamaṃ.

60."Monks, a monk endowed with seven qualities will, before long, by realizing for himself with direct knowledge the destruction of the taints, and by realizing for himself with direct knowledge the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, he dwells having attained it in this very life. What are these seven? Here, monks, a monk is faithful, virtuous, learned, secluded, energetic, mindful, and wise. Monks, a monk endowed with these seven qualities will, before long, by realizing for himself with direct knowledge the destruction of the taints, and by realizing for himself with direct knowledge the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, he dwells having attained it in this very life." The seventh.
