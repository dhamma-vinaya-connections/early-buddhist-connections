## AN 7.49 Second Perception Discourse

49. ‘‘Sattimā, bhikkhave, saññā bhāvitā bahulīkatā mahapphalā honti mahānisaṃsā amatogadhā amatapariyosānā. Katamā satta? Asubhasaññā, maraṇasaññā, āhāre paṭikūlasaññā, sabbaloke anabhiratasaññā, aniccasaññā, anicce dukkhasaññā, dukkhe anattasaññā. Imā kho, bhikkhave, satta saññā bhāvitā bahulīkatā mahapphalā honti mahānisaṃsā amatogadhā amatapariyosānāti.

49.Monks, these seven perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and great benefit, rooted in the Deathless, culminating in the Deathless. Which seven? The perception of unattractiveness, the perception of death, the perception of disgust with food, the perception of non-delight in the entire world, the perception of impermanence, the perception of suffering in the impermanent, and the perception of non-self in suffering. These, monks, are the seven perceptions that, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and great benefit, rooted in the Deathless, culminating in the Deathless.

‘‘‘Asubhasaññā, bhikkhave, bhāvitā bahulīkatā mahapphalā hoti mahānisaṃsā amatogadhā amatapariyosānā’ti. Iti kho panetaṃ vuttaṃ. Kiñcetaṃ paṭicca vuttaṃ? Asubhasaññāparicitena, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno cetasā bahulaṃ viharato methunadhammasamāpattiyā cittaṃ patilīyati patikuṭati pativattati, na sampasāriyati upekkhā vā pāṭikulyatā vā saṇṭhāti. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, kukkuṭapattaṃ vā nhārudaddulaṃ vā aggimhi pakkhittaṃ patilīyati patikuṭati pativattati, na sampasāriyati. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno asubhasaññāparicitena cetasā bahulaṃ viharato methunadhammasamāpattiyā cittaṃ patilīyati patikuṭati pativattati, na sampasāriyati upekkhā vā pāṭikulyatā vā saṇṭhāti.

‘The perception of unattractiveness, monks, when developed and cultivated, is of great fruit and great benefit, rooted in the Deathless, culminating in the Deathless.’ Thus it was said. And with reference to what was it said? Monks, when a bhikkhu dwells frequently with a mind familiar with the perception of unattractiveness, his mind recoils, shrinks back, and turns away from indulgence in sexual intercourse; it does not expand, and either equanimity or revulsion becomes established. Just as, monks, a chicken feather or a strip of sinew, when thrown into a fire, recoils, shrinks back, and turns away, and does not expand—in the same way, monks, when a bhikkhu dwells frequently with a mind familiar with the perception of unattractiveness, his mind recoils, shrinks back, and turns away from indulgence in sexual intercourse; it does not expand, and either equanimity or revulsion becomes established.

‘‘Sace, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno asubhasaññāparicitena cetasā bahulaṃ viharato methunadhammasamāpattiyā cittaṃ anusandahati [anusaṇṭhāti (sī.)] appaṭikulyatā saṇṭhāti; veditabbametaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā ‘abhāvitā me asubhasaññā, natthi me pubbenāparaṃ viseso, appattaṃ me bhāvanābala’nti. Itiha tattha sampajāno hoti. Sace pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno asubhasaññāparicitena cetasā bahulaṃ viharato methunadhammasamāpattiyā cittaṃ patilīyati patikuṭati pativattati, na sampasāriyati upekkhā vā pāṭikulyatā vā saṇṭhāti; veditabbametaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā ‘subhāvitā me asubhasaññā, atthi me pubbenāparaṃ viseso, pattaṃ me bhāvanābala’nti. Itiha tattha sampajāno hoti. ‘Asubhasaññā, bhikkhave, bhāvitā bahulīkatā mahapphalā hoti mahānisaṃsā amatogadhā amatapariyosānā’ti, iti yaṃ taṃ vuttaṃ idametaṃ paṭicca vuttaṃ.

Monks, if a bhikkhu frequently dwells with a mind familiar with the perception of unattractiveness, and his mind pursues indulgence in sexual intercourse, and non-revulsion is established, he should understand: 'My perception of unattractiveness is undeveloped; there is no progress for me; I have not attained the power of development.' Thus he is clearly aware in that situation. But monks, if a bhikkhu frequently dwells with a mind familiar with the perception of unattractiveness, his mind recoils, shrinks back, and turns away from indulgence in sexual intercourse, and either equanimity or revulsion is established, he should understand: 'My perception of unattractiveness is well-developed; there is progress for me; I have attained the power of development.' Thus he is clearly aware in that situation. ‘The perception of unattractiveness, monks, when developed and cultivated, is of great fruit and great benefit, rooted in the Deathless, culminating in the Deathless.’ Thus it was said, and it was with reference to this that it was said.

‘‘‘Maraṇasaññā, bhikkhave, bhāvitā bahulīkatā mahapphalā hoti mahānisaṃsā amatogadhā amatapariyosānā’ti, iti kho panetaṃ vuttaṃ kiñcetaṃ paṭicca vuttaṃ?

Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, kukkuṭapattaṃ vā nhārudaddulaṃ vā aggimhi pakkhittaṃ patilīyati patikuṭati pativattati, na sampasāriyati. Evamevaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno maraṇasaññāparicitena cetasā bahulaṃ viharato jīvitanikantiyā cittaṃ patilīyati patikuṭati pativattati, na sampasāriyati upekkhā vā pāṭikulyatā vā saṇṭhāti.

‘The perception of death, monks, when developed and cultivated, is of great fruit and great benefit, rooted in the Deathless, culminating in the Deathless.’ Thus it was said. And with reference to what was it said? Monks, when a bhikkhu dwells frequently with a mind familiar with the perception of death, his mind recoils, shrinks back, and turns away from attachment to life. It does not expand, and either equanimity or revulsion becomes established. Just as, monks, a chicken feather or a strip of sinew, when thrown into a fire, recoils, shrinks back, and turns away, and does not expand—in the same way, monks, when a bhikkhu dwells frequently with a mind familiar with the perception of death, his mind recoils, shrinks back, and turns away from attachment to life. It does not expand, and either equanimity or revulsion becomes established.

‘‘Sace, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno maraṇasaññāparicitena cetasā bahulaṃ viharato jīvitanikantiyā cittaṃ anusandahati appaṭikulyatā saṇṭhāti; veditabbametaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā ‘abhāvitā me maraṇasaññā, natthi me pubbenāparaṃ viseso, appattaṃ me bhāvanābala’nti. Itiha tattha sampajāno hoti. Sace pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno maraṇasaññāparicitena cetasā bahulaṃ viharato jīvitanikantiyā cittaṃ patilīyati patikuṭati pativattati, na sampasāriyati upekkhā vā pāṭikulyatā vā saṇṭhāti; veditabbametaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā ‘subhāvitā me maraṇasaññā, atthi me pubbenāparaṃ viseso, pattaṃ me bhāvanābala’nti. Itiha tattha sampajāno hoti. ‘Maraṇasaññā, bhikkhave, bhāvitā bahulīkatā mahapphalā hoti mahānisaṃsā amatogadhā amatapariyosānā’ti, iti yaṃ taṃ vuttaṃ idametaṃ paṭicca vuttaṃ.

Monks, if a bhikkhu frequently dwells with a mind familiar with the perception of death, and his mind pursues attachment to life, and non-revulsion is established, he should understand: 'My perception of death is undeveloped; there is no progress for me; I have not attained the power of development.'

Thus he is clearly aware in that situation. ‘The perception of death, monks, when developed and cultivated, is of great fruit and great benefit, rooted in the Deathless, culminating in the Deathless.’ Thus it was said, and it was with reference to this that it was said.

‘‘‘Āhāre paṭikūlasaññā, bhikkhave, bhāvitā bahulīkatā mahapphalā hoti mahānisaṃsā amatogadhā amatapariyosānā’ti, iti kho panetaṃ vuttaṃ, kiñcetaṃ paṭicca vuttaṃ?

Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, kukkuṭapattaṃ vā nhārudaddulaṃ vā aggimhi pakkhittaṃ patilīyati patikuṭati pativattati, na sampasāriyati.

‘The perception of disgust with food, monks, when developed and cultivated, is of great fruit and great benefit, rooted in the Deathless, culminating in the Deathless.’ Thus it was said. And with reference to what was it said? Monks, when a bhikkhu dwells frequently with a mind familiar with the perception of disgust with food, his mind recoils, shrinks back, and turns away from craving for tastes; it does not expand, and either equanimity or revulsion becomes established. Just as, monks, a chicken feather or a strip of sinew, when thrown into a fire, recoils, shrinks back, and turns away, and does not expand—in the same way, monks, when a bhikkhu dwells frequently with a mind familiar with the perception of disgust with food, his mind recoils, shrinks back, and turns away from craving for tastes; it does not expand, and either equanimity or revulsion becomes established.

‘‘Sace, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno āhāre paṭikūlasaññāparicitena cetasā bahulaṃ viharato rasataṇhāya cittaṃ anusandahati appaṭikulyatā saṇṭhāti; veditabbametaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā ‘abhāvitā me āhāre paṭikūlasaññā, natthi me pubbenāparaṃ viseso, appattaṃ me bhāvanābala’nti.

‘‘‘Sabbaloke anabhiratasaññā, bhikkhave, bhāvitā bahulīkatā mahapphalā hoti mahānisaṃsā amatogadhā amatapariyosānā’ti, iti kho panetaṃ vuttaṃ. Kiñcetaṃ paṭicca vuttaṃ?

‘The perception of non-delight in the entire world, monks, when developed and cultivated, is of great fruit and great benefit, rooted in the Deathless, culminating in the Deathless.’ Thus it was said. And with reference to what was it said? Monks, when a bhikkhu dwells frequently with a mind familiar with the perception of non-delight in the entire world, his mind recoils, shrinks back, and turns away from worldly attractions; it does not expand, and either equanimity or revulsion becomes established. Just as, monks, a chicken feather or a strip of sinew, when thrown into a fire, recoils, shrinks back, and turns away, and does not expand—in the same way, monks, when a bhikkhu dwells frequently with a mind familiar with the perception of non-delight in the entire world, his mind recoils, shrinks back, and turns away from worldly attractions; it does not expand, and either equanimity or revulsion becomes established.

‘‘Sace, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno sabbaloke anabhiratasaññāparicitena cetasā bahulaṃ viharato lokacitresu cittaṃ anusandahati appaṭikulyatā saṇṭhāti; veditabbametaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā ‘abhāvitā me sabbaloke anabhiratasaññā, natthi me pubbenāparaṃ viseso, appattaṃ me bhāvanābala’nti.

"If, bhikkhus, while a bhikkhu frequently dwells with a mind familiar with the perception of non-delight in the entire world, his mind still inclines to the world's variegations and non-revulsion becomes established, he should understand: ‘The perception of non-delight in the entire world is undeveloped in me; there is no distinction for me between the prior and subsequent state; I have not attained the power of development.’ Thus he is clearly aware in that respect. But if, bhikkhus, while a bhikkhu frequently dwells with a mind familiar with the perception of non-delight in the entire world, his mind recoils from the world's variegations... and either equanimity or revulsion becomes established, he should understand: ‘The perception of non-delight in the entire world is well-developed in me; there is a distinction for me between the prior and subsequent state; I have attained the power of development.’ Thus he is clearly aware in that respect. ‘The perception of non-delight in the entire world, bhikkhus, when developed and cultivated, is of great fruit, great benefit, grounded in the deathless, ending in the deathless.’ This was said with reference to this."

‘‘‘Aniccasaññā, bhikkhave, bhāvitā bahulīkatā mahapphalā hoti mahānisaṃsā amatogadhā amatapariyosānā’ti, iti kho panetaṃ vuttaṃ. Kiñcetaṃ paṭicca vuttaṃ?

"‘The perception of impermanence, bhikkhus, when developed and cultivated, is of great fruit, great benefit, grounded in the deathless, ending in the deathless.’ Thus it has been said. And with reference to what was this said? When a bhikkhu’s mind is frequently familiar with the perception of impermanence, his mind shrinks away from gain, honor, and praise... and either equanimity or revulsion becomes established. Just as, bhikkhus, a chicken feather or a strip of sinew thrown into a fire shrinks away, curls up, turns back, and does not expand. In the same way, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu’s mind is frequently familiar with the perception of impermanence, his mind shrinks away from gain, honor, and praise... and either equanimity or revulsion becomes established."

"‘The perception of suffering in the impermanent, bhikkhus, when developed and cultivated, is of great fruit, great benefit, grounded in the deathless, ending in the deathless.’ Thus it has been said. And with reference to what was this said? When a bhikkhu frequently dwells with a mind familiar with the perception of suffering in the impermanent, bhikkhus, a keen perception of danger arises in him regarding laziness, indolence, laxity, negligence, lack of application, and lack of reflection—just as if an executioner with an uplifted sword were standing over him."
