# Snp 3.8 Sallasuttaṃ

## Snp 3.8 The Dart

579.

Animittamanaññātaṃ, maccānaṃ idha jīvitaṃ;Kasirañca parittañca, tañca dukkhena saṃyutaṃ.

Unindicated and unknown is the life of mortals here; difficult and brief, it is yoked with suffering.

580.

Na hi so upakkamo atthi, yena jātā na miyyare;Jarampi patvā maraṇaṃ, evaṃdhammā hi pāṇino.

For there exists no means by which those who are born will not die; after reaching old age, there is death—such is the nature of living beings.

581.

Phalānamiva pakkānaṃ, pāto patanato [papatato (sī. pī. aṭṭha.)] bhayaṃ;Evaṃ jātāna maccānaṃ, niccaṃ maraṇato bhayaṃ.

Just as for ripe fruits there is fear of falling in the morning, so for mortals who are born there is constant fear of death.

582.

Yathāpi kumbhakārassa, katā mattikabhājanā;Sabbe bhedanapariyantā [bhedapariyantā (syā.)], evaṃ maccāna jīvitaṃ.

Just as the clay vessels made by a potter all have breaking as their end, so too is the life of mortals.

583.

Daharā ca mahantā ca, ye bālā ye ca paṇḍitā;Sabbe maccuvasaṃ yanti, sabbe maccuparāyaṇā.

The young and the great, the foolish and the wise, all fall under the sway of death; all have death as their destination.

584.

Tesaṃ maccuparetānaṃ, gacchataṃ paralokato;Na pitā tāyate puttaṃ, ñātī vā pana ñātake.

For those overcome by death, departing for the next world, a father cannot protect his son, nor can relatives protect their kin.

585.

Pekkhataṃ yeva ñātīnaṃ, passa lālapataṃ puthu;Ekamekova maccānaṃ, govajjho viya nīyati [niyyati (bahūsu)].

While their kinsmen are looking on and lamenting profusely, one by one mortals are led away, like an ox to the slaughter.

586.

Evamabbhāhato loko, maccunā ca jarāya ca;Tasmā dhīrā na socanti, viditvā lokapariyāyaṃ.

Thus the world is afflicted by death and old age. Therefore the wise do not grieve, having understood the way of the world.

587.

Yassa maggaṃ na jānāsi, āgatassa gatassa vā;Ubho ante asampassaṃ, niratthaṃ paridevasi.

Of one whose path you do not know, whether coming or going, you lament in vain, not seeing either end.

588.

Paridevayamāno ce, kiñcidatthaṃ udabbahe;Sammūḷho hiṃsamattānaṃ, kayirā ce naṃ vicakkhaṇo.

If by lamenting, a confused person harming himself could gain any benefit, the wise person would do it too.

589.

Na hi ruṇṇena sokena, santiṃ pappoti cetaso;Bhiyyassuppajjate dukkhaṃ, sarīraṃ cupahaññati.

Not by weeping nor by sorrowing does one attain peace of mind; on the contrary, more suffering arises and the body is harmed.

590.

Kiso vivaṇṇo bhavati, hiṃsamattānamattanā;Na tena petā pālenti, niratthā paridevanā.

One becomes thin and pale, harming oneself by one's own doing. The departed are not sustained by that; lamentation is futile.

591.

Sokamappajahaṃ jantu, bhiyyo dukkhaṃ nigacchati;Anutthunanto kālaṅkataṃ [kālakataṃ (sī. syā.)], sokassa vasamanvagū.

A person who does not abandon sorrow falls into even more suffering. Mourning for one who has passed away, one has come under the sway of sorrow.

592.

Aññepi passa gamine, yathākammūpage nare;Maccuno vasamāgamma, phandantevidha pāṇino.

Behold other people, too, faring on according to their deeds; having fallen into the sway of Death, the creatures here are trembling.

593.

Yena yena hi maññanti, tato taṃ hoti aññathā;Etādiso vinābhāvo, passa lokassa pariyāyaṃ.

In whatever way they conceive things, it turns out to be different from that. Such is the nature of separation—see the way of the world!

594.

Api vassasataṃ jīve, bhiyyo vā pana māṇavo;Ñātisaṅghā vinā hoti, jahāti idha jīvitaṃ.

Even if a person should live a hundred years, or even more, he is separated from his host of relatives and gives up his life in this world.

595.

Tasmā arahato sutvā, vineyya paridevitaṃ;Petaṃ kālaṅkataṃ disvā, neso labbhā mayā iti.

Therefore, having heard the Arahant, one should subdue lamentation. Seeing the one who has passed away, one should know: 'He cannot be brought back by me.'

596.

Yathā saraṇamādittaṃ, vārinā parinibbaye [parinibbuto (sī. ka.)];Evampi dhīro sapañño, paṇḍito kusalo naro;Khippamuppatitaṃ sokaṃ, vāto tūlaṃva dhaṃsaye.

Just as one would extinguish a burning shelter with water, so the steadfast, intelligent, wise, and skilled person should quickly dispel arisen sorrow, like the wind a tuft of cotton.

597.

Paridevaṃ pajappañca, domanassañca attano;Attano sukhamesāno, abbahe sallamattano.

One who seeks his own happiness should pull out his own dart: his lamentation, longing, and grief.

598.

Abbuḷhasallo asito, santiṃ pappuyya cetaso;Sabbasokaṃ atikkanto, asoko hoti nibbutoti.

With the dart drawn out, unattached, having attained peace of mind, having passed beyond all sorrow, one is sorrowless, fully quenched.

Sallasuttaṃ aṭṭhamaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ.

The Discourse on the Dart, the eighth, is finished.
