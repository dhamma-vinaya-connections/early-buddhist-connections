## Snp 3.6 The Sutta on Sabhiya

Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā rājagahe viharati veḷuvane kalandakanivāpe. Tena kho pana samayena sabhiyassa paribbājakassa purāṇasālohitāya devatāya pañhā uddiṭṭhā honti – ‘‘yo te, sabhiya, samaṇo vā brāhmaṇo vā ime pañhe puṭṭho byākaroti tassa santike brahmacariyaṃ careyyāsī’’ti.

Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. Now at that time, the wanderer Sabhiya had been given questions by a deity who was a former blood-relative: "Sabhiya, whichever ascetic or brahmin answers these questions when asked, you should live the holy life under him."

Atha kho sabhiyo paribbājako tassā devatāya santike te pañhe uggahetvā ye te samaṇabrāhmaṇā saṅghino gaṇino gaṇācariyā ñātā yasassino titthakarā sādhusammatā bahujanassa, seyyathidaṃ – pūraṇo kassapo makkhaligosālo ajito kesakambalo pakudho [kakudho (sī.) pakuddho (syā. kaṃ.)] kaccāno sañcayo [sañjayo (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] belaṭṭhaputto [bellaṭṭhiputto (sī. pī.), veḷaṭṭhaputto (syā.)] nigaṇṭho nāṭaputto [nātaputto (sī. pī.)], te upasaṅkamitvā te pañhe pucchati. Te sabhiyena paribbājakena pañhe puṭṭhā na sampāyanti; asampāyantā kopañca dosañca appaccayañca pātukaronti. Api ca sabhiyaṃ yeva paribbājakaṃ paṭipucchanti.

Then the wanderer Sabhiya, having learned those questions from that deity, approached those ascetics and brahmins who were leaders of communities, leaders of groups, teachers of groups, well-known, famous, founders of sects, and regarded as holy by many people—that is, Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta, and the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta—and asked them those questions. But when questioned by the wanderer Sabhiya, they could not answer. Unable to answer, they showed anger, ill will, and resentment, and they even cross-questioned the wanderer Sabhiya.

Atha kho sabhiyassa paribbājakassa etadahosi – ‘‘ye kho te bhonto samaṇabrāhmaṇā saṅghino gaṇino gaṇācariyā ñātā yasassino titthakarā sādhusammatā bahujanassa, seyyathidaṃ – pūraṇo kassapo…pe… nigaṇṭho nāṭaputto, te mayā pañhe puṭṭhā na sampāyanti, asampāyantā kopañca dosañca appaccayañca pātukaronti; api ca maññevettha paṭipucchanti. Yannūnnāhaṃ hīnāyāvattitvā kāme paribhuñjeyya’’nti.

Then it occurred to the wanderer Sabhiya: "Those venerable ascetics and brahmins who are leaders of communities, leaders of groups, teachers of groups, well-known, famous, founders of sects, and regarded as holy by many people—that is, Pūraṇa Kassapa... the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta—when questioned by me, could not answer. Unable to answer, they showed anger, ill will, and resentment, and they even cross-questioned me. Why don't I return to the lower life and enjoy sensual pleasures?"

Atha kho sabhiyassa paribbājakassa etadahosi – ‘‘ayampi kho samaṇo gotamo saṅghī ceva gaṇī ca gaṇācariyo ca ñāto yasassī titthakaro sādhusammato bahujanassa; yaṃnūnāhaṃ samaṇaṃ gotamaṃ upasaṅkamitvā ime pañhe puccheyya’’nti.

Then it occurred to the wanderer Sabhiya: "This ascetic Gotama is also a leader of a community, a leader of a group, and a teacher of a group; he is well-known, famous, a founder of a sect, and regarded as holy by many people. Why don't I approach the ascetic Gotama and ask him these questions?"

Atha kho sabhiyassa paribbājakassa etadahosi – ‘‘yepi kho te [ye kho te (syā.), yaṃ kho te (ka.)] bhonto samaṇabrāhmaṇā jiṇṇā vuḍḍhā mahallakā addhagatā vayoanuppattā therā rattaññū cirapabbajitā saṅghino gaṇino gaṇācariyā ñātā yasassino titthakarā sādhusammatā bahujanassa, seyyathidaṃ – pūraṇo kassapo…pe. … nigaṇṭho nāṭaputto, tepi mayā pañhe puṭṭhā na sampāyanti, asampāyantā kopañca dosañca appaccayañca pātukaronti, api ca maññevettha paṭipucchanti; kiṃ pana me samaṇo gotamo ime pañhe puṭṭho byākarissati! Samaṇo hi gotamo daharo ceva jātiyā, navo ca pabbajjāyā’’ti.

Then it occurred to the wanderer Sabhiya: "Those venerable ascetics and brahmins who are aged, old, elderly, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life, elders, of long standing, long gone forth, leaders of communities, leaders of groups, teachers of groups, well-known, famous, founders of sects, and regarded as holy by many people—that is, Pūraṇa Kassapa... the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta—even they, when questioned by me, could not answer. Unable to answer, they showed anger, ill will, and resentment, and they even cross-questioned me. How, then, will the ascetic Gotama answer these questions when he is asked? For the ascetic Gotama is young by birth and new to the homeless life."

Atha kho sabhiyassa paribbājakassa etadahosi – ‘‘samaṇo kho [samaṇo kho gotamo (syā. ka.)] daharoti na uññātabbo na paribhotabbo. Daharopi cesa samaṇo gotamo mahiddhiko hoti mahānubhāvo, yaṃnūnāhaṃ samaṇaṃ gotamaṃ upasaṅkamitvā ime pañhe puccheyya’’nti.

Then it occurred to the wanderer Sabhiya: "An ascetic should not be despised or scorned for being young. For though the ascetic Gotama is young, he is of great psychic power and great might. Why don't I approach the ascetic Gotama and ask him these questions?"

Atha kho sabhiyo paribbājako yena rājagahaṃ tena cārikaṃ pakkāmi. Anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena rājagahaṃ veḷuvanaṃ kalandakanivāpo, yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavatā saddhiṃ sammodi. Sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho sabhiyo paribbājako bhagavantaṃ gāthāya ajjhabhāsi –

Then the wanderer Sabhiya set out to wander towards Rājagaha. Wandering by stages, he came to Rājagaha, to the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary, and he approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the wanderer Sabhiya addressed the Blessed One in verse:

515.

‘‘Kaṅkhī vecikicchī āgamaṃ, (iti sabhiyo)Pañhe pucchituṃ abhikaṅkhamāno;Tesantakaro bhavāhi [bhavāhi me (pī. ka.)] pañhe me puṭṭho,Anupubbaṃ anudhammaṃ byākarohi me’’.

"Full of doubt and perplexity I have come," (said Sabhiya)
"desiring to ask questions.
Put an end to them for me; when I ask,
explain them to me in sequence and in accordance with the Dhamma."

516.

‘‘Dūrato āgatosi sabhiya, (iti bhagavā)Pañhe pucchituṃ abhikaṅkhamāno;Tesantakaro bhavāmi [tesamantakaromi te (ka.)] pañhe te puṭṭho,Anupubbaṃ anudhammaṃ byākaromi te.

"You have come from afar, Sabhiya," (said the Blessed One)
"desiring to ask questions.
I will put an end to them for you; when you ask,
I will explain them to you in sequence and in accordance with the Dhamma.

517.

‘‘Puccha maṃ sabhiya pañhaṃ, yaṃ kiñci manasicchasi;Tassa tasseva pañhassa, ahaṃ antaṃ karomi te’’ti.

"Ask me, Sabhiya, any question you wish.
For each and every question,
I will make an end of it for you."

Atha kho sabhiyassa paribbājakassa etadahosi – ‘‘acchariyaṃ vata, bho, abbhutaṃ vata, bho! Yaṃ vatāhaṃ aññesu samaṇabrāhmaṇesu okāsakammamattampi [okāsamattampi (sī. pī.)] nālatthaṃ taṃ me idaṃ samaṇena gotamena okāsakammaṃ kata’’nti. Attamano pamudito udaggo pītisomanassajāto bhagavantaṃ pañhaṃ apucchi –

Then it occurred to the wanderer Sabhiya: "It is wonderful, indeed! It is amazing, indeed! The opportunity that I did not obtain from other ascetics and brahmins has been created for me by the ascetic Gotama." Delighted, elated, uplifted, filled with joy and gladness, he asked the Blessed One a question:

518.

‘‘Kiṃ pattinamāhu bhikkhunaṃ, (iti sabhiyo)Sorataṃ kena kathañca dantamāhu;Buddhoti kathaṃ pavuccati,Puṭṭho me bhagavā byākarohi’’.

"Having attained what do they call one a bhikkhu?" (said Sabhiya)
"How is one gentle, and how is one called tamed?
How is one called a Buddha?
Having been asked, O Blessed One, please explain this to me."

519.

‘‘Pajjena katena attanā, (sabhiyāti bhagavā)Parinibbānagato vitiṇṇakaṅkho;Vibhavañca bhavañca vippahāya,Vusitavā khīṇapunabbhavo sa bhikkhu.

"By the path he has fashioned for himself," (the Blessed One said to Sabhiya)
"gone to Parinibbāna, with doubt crossed over;
having abandoned both non-becoming and becoming,
he has lived the holy life, his renewed existence is destroyed—he is a bhikkhu.

520.

‘‘Sabbattha upekkhako satimā, na so hiṃsati kañci sabbaloke;Tiṇṇo samaṇo anāvilo, ussadā yassa na santi sorato so.

"Everywhere equanimous and mindful,
he harms no one in the entire world.
A recluse who has crossed over, he is untroubled;
one for whom there are no conceits—he is gentle.

521.

‘‘Yassindriyāni bhāvitāni, ajjhattaṃ bahiddhā ca sabbaloke;Nibbijjha imaṃ parañca lokaṃ, kālaṃ kaṅkhati bhāvito sa danto.

"He whose faculties are developed
internally and externally in the whole world;
having penetrated this world and the next,
this developed one awaits his time—he is the tamed one.

522.

‘‘Kappāni viceyya kevalāni, saṃsāraṃ dubhayaṃ cutūpapātaṃ;Vigatarajamanaṅgaṇaṃ visuddhaṃ, pattaṃ jātikhayaṃ tamāhu buddha’’nti.

"Having fully investigated the eons,
the entire round of rebirths with its passing away and reappearance;
being dustless, stainless, purified,
and having attained the destruction of birth—him they call a Buddha."

Atha kho sabhiyo paribbājako bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinanditvā anumoditvā attamano pamudito udaggo pītisomanassajāto bhagavantaṃ uttariṃ [uttari (ka.)] pañhaṃ apucchi –

Then Sabhiya the wanderer, delighting in and rejoicing at the Blessed One's statement, was delighted, elated, uplifted, and filled with joy and gladness. He asked the Blessed One a further question:

523.

‘‘Kiṃ pattinamāhu brāhmaṇaṃ, (iti sabhiyo)Samaṇaṃ kena kathañca nhātakoti;Nāgoti kathaṃ pavuccati,Puṭṭho me bhagavā byākarohi’’.

"Having attained what do they call one a brahmin?" (said Sabhiya)
"By what is one a recluse, and how is one called a bathed one?
How is one called a Nāga?
Having been asked, O Blessed One, please explain this to me."

524.

‘‘Bāhitvā sabbapāpakāni, (sabhiyāti bhagavā)Vimalo sādhusamāhito ṭhitatto;Saṃsāramaticca kevalī so,Asito tādi pavuccate sa brahmā.

"Having banished all evil deeds," (the Blessed One said to Sabhiya)
"stainless, well-concentrated, of steadfast nature;
having crossed beyond saṃsāra, accomplished, unattached—
such a one is rightly called a brahmin.

525.

‘‘Samitāvi pahāya puññapāpaṃ, virajo ñatvā imaṃ parañca lokaṃ;Jātimaraṇaṃ upātivatto, samaṇo tādi pavuccate tathattā.

"One who is tranquil, having abandoned merit and evil,
dustless, having understood this world and the next,
and having transcended birth and death—
such a one is called a recluse because he is so.

526.

‘‘Ninhāya [ninahāya (syā.)] sabbapāpakāni, ajjhattaṃ bahiddhā ca sabbaloke;Devamanussesu kappiyesu, kappaṃ neti tamāhu nhātako’’ti.

"Having washed off all evil deeds
internally and externally in the entire world;
one who does not enter a new cycle among gods and humans—
him they call a ‘bathed one.’

527.

‘‘Āguṃ na karoti kiñci loke, sabbasaṃyoge [sabbayoge (ka.)] visajja bandhanāni;Sabbattha na sajjatī vimutto, nāgo tādi pavuccate tathattā’’ti.

"He commits no transgression at all in the world;
having cast off all yokes and bonds,
he is nowhere attached, liberated—
such a one is called a Nāga because he is so."

Atha kho sabhiyo paribbājako…pe… bhagavantaṃ uttariṃ pañhaṃ apucchi –

Then Sabhiya the wanderer, delighting in and rejoicing at the Blessed One's statement, was delighted, elated, uplifted, and filled with joy and gladness. He asked the Blessed One a further question:

528.

‘‘Kaṃ khettajinaṃ vadanti buddhā, (iti sabhiyo)Kusalaṃ kena kathañca paṇḍitoti;Muni nāma kathaṃ pavuccati,Puṭṭho me bhagavā byākarohi’’.

"Whom do the Buddhas call a conqueror of the field?" (said Sabhiya)
"By what is one skilled, and how is one wise?
How is one called a sage?
Having been asked, O Blessed One, please explain this to me."

529.

‘‘Khettāni viceyya kevalāni, (sabhiyāti bhagavā)Dibbaṃ mānusakañca brahmakhettaṃ;Sabbakhettamūlabandhanā pamutto,Khettajino tādi pavuccate tathattā.

"Having investigated all the fields—" (the Blessed One said to Sabhiya)
"the divine, the human, and the Brahmā-field—
one who is freed from the root-bondage of all fields,
such a one is called a conqueror of fields because he is so.

530.

‘‘Kosāni viceyya kevalāni, dibbaṃ mānusakañca brahmakosaṃ;Sabbakosamūlabandhanā pamutto, kusalo tādi pavuccate tathattā.

"Having investigated all the sheaths—
the divine, the human, and the Brahmā-sheath—
one who is freed from the root-bondage of all sheaths,
such a one is called skilled because he is so.

531.

‘‘Dubhayāni viceyya paṇḍarāni, ajjhattaṃ bahiddhā ca suddhipañño;Kaṇhaṃ sukkaṃ upātivatto, paṇḍito tādi pavuccate tathattā.

"Having investigated both kinds of purity,
the internal and the external, one of pure wisdom;
having transcended the dark and the bright—
such a one is called wise because he is so.

532.

‘‘Asatañca satañca ñatvā dhammaṃ, ajjhattaṃ bahiddhā ca sabbaloke;Devamanussehi pūjanīyo, saṅgaṃ jālamaticca so munī’’ti.

"Having understood the real and the unreal,
internally and externally in the whole world,
he is worthy of honor by gods and humans;
having surmounted the net of attachment—he is a sage."

Atha kho sabhiyo paribbājako…pe… bhagavantaṃ uttariṃ pañhaṃ apucchi –

Then Sabhiya the wanderer, delighting in and rejoicing at the Blessed One's statement, was delighted, elated, uplifted, and filled with joy and gladness. He asked the Blessed One a further question:

533.

‘‘Kiṃ pattinamāhu vedaguṃ, (iti sabhiyo)Anuviditaṃ kena kathañca vīriyavāti;Ājāniyo kinti nāma hoti,Puṭṭho me bhagavā byākarohi’’.

"Having attained what do they call one a lore-master?" (said Sabhiya)
"By what is one discerning, and how is one called energetic?
How does one come to be called a thoroughbred?
Having been asked, O Blessed One, please explain this to me."

534.

‘‘Vedāni viceyya kevalāni, (sabhiyāti bhagavā)Samaṇānaṃ yānidhatthi [yānipatthi (sī. syā. pī.)] brāhmaṇānaṃ;Sabbavedanāsu vītarāgo,Sabbaṃ vedamaticca vedagū so.

"Having investigated all the lores," (the Blessed One said to Sabhiya)
"of ascetics and also of brahmins;
one who is free from lust for all feelings,
having transcended all lore, is a lore-master.

535.

‘‘Anuvicca papañcanāmarūpaṃ, ajjhattaṃ bahiddhā ca rogamūlaṃ;Sabbarogamūlabandhanā pamutto, anuvidito tādi pavuccate tathattā.

"Having discerned proliferation as name-and-form,
the root of disease, internally and externally;
freed from the root-bondage of all disease—
such a one is called discerning because he is so.

536.

"He who abstains here from all evil deeds,
having transcended the suffering of hell—he is energetic.
That energetic one is a striver; a hero,
such a one is called so because he is so.

537.

"He whose bonds have been cut,
internally and externally, the root of attachment;
freed from the root-bondage of all attachment—
such a one is called a thoroughbred because he is so."

Atha kho sabhiyo paribbājako…pe… bhagavantaṃ uttariṃ pañhaṃ apucchi –

Then Sabhiya the wanderer … asked the Blessed One a further question:

538.

‘‘Kiṃ pattinamāhu sottiyaṃ, (iti sabhiyo)Ariyaṃ kena kathañca caraṇavāti;Paribbājako kinti nāma hoti,Puṭṭho me bhagavā byākarohi’’.

“Whom do they call a scholar who has attained? (so said Sabhiya) By what is one noble, and how endowed with conduct? How is one a wanderer? Being asked, O Blessed One, please explain it to me.”

539.

‘‘Sutvā sabbadhammaṃ abhiññāya loke, (sabhiyāti bhagavā)Sāvajjānavajjaṃ yadatthi kiñci;Abhibhuṃ akathaṃkathiṃ vimuttaṃ,Anighaṃ sabbadhimāhu sottiyoti.

“Having heard and directly known all phenomena in the world,” (the Blessed One said to Sabhiya) “whatever there is, blameworthy and blameless; one who is a master, free from doubt, liberated, untroubled in every way—him they call a scholar.”

540.

‘‘Chetvā āsavāni ālayāni, vidvā so na upeti gabbhaseyyaṃ;Saññaṃ tividhaṃ panujja paṅkaṃ, kappaṃ neti tamāhu ariyoti.

“Having cut off the taints and attachments, the wise one does not return to lying in a womb; having dispelled threefold perception and the mire, he does not go on to another world-cycle—him they call a noble one.”

541.

‘‘Yo idha caraṇesu pattipatto, kusalo sabbadā ājānāti [ājāni (syā.)] dhammaṃ;Sabbattha na sajjati vimuttacitto [vimutto (sī.)], paṭighā yassa na santi caraṇavā so.

“One who here is accomplished in conduct, skilled, always understands the Dhamma; whose mind is liberated, unattached in every way, for whom there are no aversions—such a one is endowed with good conduct.”

542.

‘‘Dukkhavepakkaṃ yadatthi kammaṃ, uddhamadho tiriyaṃ vāpi [tiriyañcāpi (syā.)] majjhe;Paribbājayitvā pariññacārī, māyaṃ mānamathopi lobhakodhaṃ;Pariyantamakāsi nāmarūpaṃ, taṃ paribbājakamāhu pattipatta’’nti.

“One who fares with full understanding, having abandoned whatever kamma there is that ripens in suffering—above, below, across, or in the middle—along with deceit, conceit, greed, and anger; who has made an end of name-and-form: him they call a wanderer, one who has reached the goal.”

Atha kho sabhiyo paribbājako bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinanditvā anumoditvā attamano pamudito udaggo pītisomanassajāto uṭṭhāyāsanā ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā yena bhagavā tenañjaliṃ paṇāmetvā bhagavantaṃ sammukhā sāruppāhi gāthāhi abhitthavi –

Then Sabhiya the wanderer, delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed One’s words, pleased and elated, filled with rapture and happiness, rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, extended his hands in reverential salutation toward the Blessed One, and praised the Blessed One to his face with fitting verses:

543.

‘‘Yāni ca tīṇi yāni ca saṭṭhi, samaṇappavādasitāni [samaṇappavādanissitāni (syā. ka.)] bhūripañña;Saññakkharasaññanissitāni, osaraṇāni vineyya oghatamagā.

“The sixty-three doctrines proclaimed by recluses, O you of vast wisdom, those resorts dependent on perception and its formulations—having dispelled them, you have crossed beyond the flood and darkness.”

544.

‘‘Antagūsi pāragū [pāragūsi (syā. pī. ka.)] dukkhassa, arahāsi sammāsambuddho khīṇāsavaṃ taṃ maññe;Jutimā mutimā pahūtapañño, dukkhassantakaraṃ atāresi maṃ.

“You have gone to the end, gone beyond suffering; you are the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One. I consider you one whose taints are destroyed, luminous, intelligent, of abundant wisdom, the end-maker of suffering who has carried me across.”

545.

‘‘Yaṃ me kaṅkhitamaññāsi, vicikicchā maṃ tārayi namo te;Muni monapathesu pattipatta, akhila ādiccabandhu soratosi.

“You have understood my doubt, you have carried me across uncertainty—homage to you! O sage who has reached the goal on the paths of sagacity, you are flawless, Kinsman of the Sun, a gentle one.”

546.

‘‘Yā me kaṅkhā pure āsi, taṃ me byākāsi cakkhumā;Addhā munīsi sambuddho, natthi nīvaraṇā tava.

“The doubt that I had before, you have explained to me, O one with vision; truly you are a sage, a Perfectly Enlightened One; there are no hindrances for you.”

547.

‘‘Upāyāsā ca te sabbe, viddhastā vinaḷīkatā;Sītibhūto damappatto, dhitimā saccanikkamo.

“All your tribulations are shattered, utterly destroyed; you have become cool, attained self-control, are resolute and firm in the truth.”

548.

‘‘Tassa te nāganāgassa, mahāvīrassa bhāsato;Sabbe devānumodanti, ubho nāradapabbatā.

“As you speak, O great being, O great hero, all the devas rejoice, both Nārada and Pabbata.”

549.

‘‘Namo te purisājañña, namo te purisuttama;Sadevakasmiṃ lokasmiṃ, natthi te paṭipuggalo.

“Homage to you, O thoroughbred among men, homage to you, O supreme among men; in this world with its devas, there is no counterpart to you.”

550.

‘‘Tuvaṃ buddho tuvaṃ satthā, tuvaṃ mārābhibhū muni;Tuvaṃ anusaye chetvā, tiṇṇo tāresi maṃ pajaṃ.

“You are the Buddha, you are the Teacher, you are the sage who has vanquished Māra. Having cut off the underlying tendencies, you have crossed over and you carry this generation across.”

551.

‘‘Upadhī te samatikkantā, āsavā te padālitā;Sīhosi anupādāno, pahīnabhayabheravo.

“You have transcended the acquisitions, your taints are shattered; you are a lion, without clinging, having abandoned fear and terror.”

552.

‘‘Puṇḍarīkaṃ yathā vaggu, toye na upalimpati [toyena na upalippati (sī.), toye na upalippati (pī.), toyena na upalimpati (ka.)];Evaṃ puññe ca pāpe ca, ubhaye tvaṃ na limpasi;Pāde vīra pasārehi, sabhiyo vandati satthuno’’ti.

“As a beautiful white lotus is not stained by water, so you are not stained by both merit and evil. O hero, extend your feet; Sabhiya worships the Teacher.”

Atha kho sabhiyo paribbājako bhagavato pādesu sirasā nipatitvā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘abhikkantaṃ, bhante…pe… esāhaṃ bhagavantaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi dhammañca bhikkhusaṅghañca; labheyyāhaṃ, bhante, bhagavato santike pabbajjaṃ, labheyyaṃ upasampada’’nti.

Then the wanderer Sabhiya fell with his head at the Blessed One’s feet and said to him: “Excellent, venerable sir! … I go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Bhikkhu Saṅgha. May I receive the going forth in the Blessed One’s presence, may I receive the higher ordination.”

‘‘Yo kho, sabhiya, aññatitthiyapubbo imasmiṃ dhammavinaye ākaṅkhati pabbajjaṃ, ākaṅkhati upasampadaṃ, so cattāro māse parivasati; catunnaṃ māsānaṃ accayena āraddhacittā bhikkhū pabbājenti, upasampādenti bhikkhubhāvāya. Api ca mettha puggalavemattatā viditā’’ti.

“Sabhiya, one who was formerly a follower of another sect and who desires the going forth and the higher ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline lives on probation for four months. At the end of four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him, they give him the going forth and the higher ordination for the state of a bhikkhu. But in this matter I recognize the difference between persons.”

‘‘Sace, bhante, aññatitthiyapubbā imasmiṃ dhammavinaye ākaṅkhantā pabbajjaṃ, ākaṅkhantā upasampadaṃ cattāro māse parivasanti, catunnaṃ māsānaṃ accayena āraddhacittā bhikkhū pabbājenti, upasampādenti bhikkhubhāvāya, ahaṃ cattāri vassāni parivasissāmi; catunnaṃ vassānaṃ accayena āraddhacittā bhikkhū pabbājentu upasampādentu bhikkhubhāvāyā’’ti. Alattha kho sabhiyo paribbājako bhagavato santike pabbajjaṃ alattha upasampadaṃ…pe… aññataro kho panāyasmā sabhiyo arahataṃ ahosīti.

“Venerable sir, if those who were formerly followers of other sects and who desire the going forth and the higher ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline live on probation for four months, and at the end of four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied with them, they give them the going forth and the higher ordination for the state of a bhikkhu, then I will live on probation for four years. At the end of four years, if the bhikkhus are satisfied with me, let them give me the going forth and the higher ordination for the state of a bhikkhu.” The wanderer Sabhiya received the going forth in the Blessed One’s presence, and he received the higher ordination. … And the Venerable Sabhiya became one of the arahants.

Sabhiyasuttaṃ chaṭṭhaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ.

The Sutta on Sabhiya, the sixth, is finished.
