## Snp 4.8 The Discourse to Pasūra

830.

Idheva suddhi iti vādayanti [vidiyanti (sī. pī.)], nāññesu dhammesu visuddhimāhu;Yaṃ nissitā tattha subhaṃ vadānā, paccekasaccesu puthū niviṭṭhā.

“‘Here alone is purification,’ they assert; they say there is no purification in other teachings. Declaring as good that which they have relied upon, they are each severally attached to their own truths.

831.

Te vādakāmā parisaṃ vigayha, bālaṃ dahantī mithu aññamaññaṃ;Vadanti te aññasitā kathojjaṃ, pasaṃsakāmā kusalā vadānā.

Fond of debate, having entered an assembly, they call one another a fool. Relying on others, they start a controversy, desiring praise, claiming to be experts.

832.

Yutto kathāyaṃ parisāya majjhe, pasaṃsamicchaṃ vinighāti hoti;Apāhatasmiṃ pana maṅku hoti, nindāya so kuppati randhamesī.

Engaged in talk in the midst of the assembly, desiring praise, he becomes agitated. But when refuted, he becomes dejected; he gets angry at censure, seeking a weak point.

833.

Yamassa vādaṃ parihīnamāhu, apāhataṃ pañhavimaṃsakāse;Paridevati socati hīnavādo, upaccagā manti anutthunāti.

When the question-investigators declare his thesis to be inferior and refuted, the one with the inferior thesis laments and grieves. ‘He has vanquished me!’ he wails.

834.

Ete vivādā samaṇesu jātā, etesu ugghāti nighāti hoti;Etampi disvā virame kathojjaṃ, na haññadatthatthipasaṃsalābhā.

These disputes have arisen among recluses; in them there is elation and dejection. Seeing this too, one should refrain from controversy, for there is no other purpose than the gain of praise.

835.

Pasaṃsito vā pana tattha hoti, akkhāya vādaṃ parisāya majjhe;So hassatī uṇṇamatī [unnamatī (?)] ca tena, pappuyya tamatthaṃ yathā mano ahu.

Or if he is praised there, having stated his thesis in the midst of the assembly, he laughs and is elated by that, having attained his goal just as he had wished.

836.

Yā uṇṇatī [unnatī (?)] sāssa vighātabhūmi, mānātimānaṃ vadate paneso;Etampi disvā na vivādayetha, na hi tena suddhiṃ kusalā vadanti.

That elation is the very ground of his vexation; and he speaks with conceit and arrogance. Seeing this too, one should not dispute, for the skillful do not say there is purification through that.

837.

Sūro yathā rājakhādāya puṭṭho, abhigajjameti paṭisūramicchaṃ;Yeneva so tena palehi sūra, pubbeva natthi yadidaṃ yudhāya.

Like a champion nourished on royal food, he goes about roaring, seeking a rival champion. O champion, by whatever way you came, flee by that way! There is nothing here to fight for yet.

838.

Ye diṭṭhimuggayha vivādayanti [vivādiyanti (sī. pī.)], idameva saccanti ca vādayanti;Te tvaṃ vadassū na hi tedha atthi, vādamhi jāte paṭisenikattā.

To those who dispute, having grasped a view, asserting, ‘This alone is the truth,’ you should say: ‘When a dispute has arisen, there is no opponent for you here.’

839.

Visenikatvā pana ye caranti, diṭṭhīhi diṭṭhiṃ avirujjhamānā;Tesu tvaṃ kiṃ labhetho pasūra, yesīdha natthī paramuggahītaṃ.

But as for those who fare on having become non-adversarial, not opposing view with views, what could you gain from them, Pasūra, in whom nothing is grasped here as supreme?

840.

Atha tvaṃ pavitakkamāgamā, manasā diṭṭhigatāni cintayanto;Dhonena yugaṃ samāgamā, na hi tvaṃ sakkhasi sampayātaveti.

Then you have come with your reasoning, pondering with your mind the things that have become views. You have come into conjunction with the Cleansed One, but you will not be able to proceed along with him.

Pasūrasuttaṃ aṭṭhamaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ.

The Discourse to Pasūra, the eighth, is finished.
