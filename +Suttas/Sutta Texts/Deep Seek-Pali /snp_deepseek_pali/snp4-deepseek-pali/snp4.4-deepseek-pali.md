# Snp 4.4 Suddhaṭṭhakasuttaṃ

## Snp 4.4 On the Pure

794.

Passāmi suddhaṃ paramaṃ arogaṃ, diṭṭhena saṃsuddhi narassa hoti;Evābhijānaṃ [etābhijānaṃ (sī. pī.)] paramanti ñatvā, suddhānupassīti pacceti ñāṇaṃ.

'I see the pure, the supreme, the diseaseless; by means of vision a person's purification occurs.' Knowing this as supreme, he relies on the knowledge that he is a 'seer of the pure.'

795.

Diṭṭhena ce suddhi narassa hoti, ñāṇena vā so pajahāti dukkhaṃ;Aññena so sujjhati sopadhīko, diṭṭhī hi naṃ pāva tathā vadānaṃ.

If purification for a person comes by seeing, or if by knowledge he could abandon suffering, then one still with acquisitions could be purified by another means. For his very view betrays him when he speaks in this way.

796.

Na brāhmaṇo aññato suddhimāha, diṭṭhe sute sīlavate mute vā;Puññe ca pāpe ca anūpalitto, attañjaho nayidha pakubbamāno.

A brahmin does not speak of purity from another—from what is seen, heard, from virtues and observances, or from what is sensed. Unsmeared by merit and evil, having abandoned self, he does not construct anything here.

797.

Purimaṃ pahāya aparaṃ sitāse, ejānugā te na taranti saṅgaṃ;Te uggahāyanti nirassajanti, kapīva sākhaṃ pamuñcaṃ gahāyaṃ [pamukhaṃ gahāya (syā.), pamuñca gahāya (ka.)].

Having abandoned the former, they are attached to the latter; following after agitation, they do not cross over attachment. They take up and they let go, like a monkey letting go of a branch to grasp another.

798.

Sayaṃ samādāya vatāni jantu, uccāvacaṃ gacchati saññasatto;Vidvā ca vedehi samecca dhammaṃ, na uccāvacaṃ gacchati bhūripañño.

A person who has himself undertaken observances goes high and low, attached to perception. But one of wide wisdom, having penetrated the Dhamma with his knowledge, does not go high and low.

799.

Sa sabbadhammesu visenibhūto, yaṃ kiñci diṭṭhaṃ va sutaṃ mutaṃ vā;Tameva dassiṃ vivaṭaṃ carantaṃ, kenīdha lokasmi vikappayeyya.

He has become detached from all phenomena—whatever is seen, heard, or sensed. Seeing him, the unveiled one, faring on, by what in this world could one classify him?

800.

Na kappayanti na purekkharonti, accantasuddhīti na te vadanti;Ādānaganthaṃ gathitaṃ visajja, āsaṃ na kubbanti kuhiñci loke.

They do not form concepts, they do not put anything forward; they do not speak of 'absolute purity.' Having relinquished the knot of grasping that ties them, they do not form a longing for anything in the world.

801.

Sīmātigo brāhmaṇo tassa natthi, ñatvā va disvā va [ñatvā ca disvā ca (ka. sī. ka.)] samuggahītaṃ;Na rāgarāgī na virāgaratto, tassīdha natthī paramuggahītanti.

The brahmin is one who has gone beyond boundaries; for him there is nothing grasped through knowing or seeing. He is not passionate for passion, nor impassioned for dispassion. For him there is nothing here taken up as supreme.

Suddhaṭṭhakasuttaṃ catutthaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ.

The Sutta on the Pure, the fourth, is finished.
