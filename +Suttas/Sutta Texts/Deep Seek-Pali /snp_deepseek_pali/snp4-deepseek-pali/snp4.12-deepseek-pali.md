## Snp 4.12 The Great Discourse on the Array

901.

Ye kecime diṭṭhiparibbasānā, idameva saccanti vivādayanti [vivādiyanti (sī. pī.)];Sabbeva te nindamanvānayanti, atho pasaṃsampi labhanti tattha.

Whoever are entrenched in their views and dispute, saying, 'This alone is true,' all of them incur blame, and they also obtain praise in that regard.

902.

Appañhi etaṃ na alaṃ samāya, duve vivādassa phalāni brūmi;Etampi disvā na vivādayetha, khemābhipassaṃ avivādabhūmiṃ.

This is a small thing, not enough for peace. I speak of two fruits of dispute. Seeing this, one should not dispute, perceiving the land of non-dispute as the state of security.

903.

Yā kācimā sammutiyo puthujjā, sabbāva etā na upeti vidvā;Anūpayo so upayaṃ kimeyya, diṭṭhe sute khantimakubbamāno.

Whatever worldly conventions there are, the wise person does not take up any of them. Being unattached, what attachment could he form? He forms no conviction based on what is seen or heard.

904.

Sīluttamā saññamenāhu suddhiṃ, vataṃ samādāya upaṭṭhitāse;Idheva sikkhema athassa suddhiṃ, bhavūpanītā kusalā vadānā.

They say that purity comes through the highest virtue and restraint. Having undertaken vows, they stand firm, saying: 'Let us train right here for this purity!' Led on to renewed existence, the experts speak thus.

905.

Sace cuto sīlavatato hoti, pavedhatī [sa vedhati (sī. pī.)] kamma virādhayitvā;Pajappatī patthayatī ca suddhiṃ, satthāva hīno pavasaṃ gharamhā.

If one falls away from one's virtue and vows, one trembles, having failed in one's practice. One yearns and longs for purity, like a person away from home who has been left behind by the caravan.

906.

Sīlabbataṃ vāpi pahāya sabbaṃ, kammañca sāvajjanavajjametaṃ;Suddhiṃ asuddhinti apatthayāno, virato care santimanuggahāya.

Having abandoned all virtue and vows, and all action both blameworthy and blameless, not longing for purity or impurity, one should wander detached, intent on peace.

907.

Tamūpanissāya jigucchitaṃ vā, athavāpi diṭṭhaṃ va sutaṃ mutaṃ vā;Uddhaṃsarā suddhimanutthunanti, avītataṇhāse bhavābhavesu.

Relying on that, or on what is loathsome, or on what is seen, heard, or sensed, they extol a purity that leads upwards, not having passed beyond craving for continued existence.

908.

Patthayamānassa hi jappitāni, pavedhitaṃ vāpi pakappitesu;Cutūpapāto idha yassa natthi, sa kena vedheyya kuhiṃva jappe [kuhiñci jappe (sī. syā. ka.), kuhiṃ pajappe (pī.) niddeso passitabbo].

For one who longs, there are yearnings and trembling in regard to things conceived. But for one who has no passing away and rebirth here, by what would he tremble? For what would he yearn?

909.

Yamāhu dhammaṃ paramanti eke, tameva hīnanti panāhu aññe;

What some call the supreme Dhamma, that very thing others call inferior.

Sacco nu vādo katamo imesaṃ, sabbeva hīme kusalā vadānā.

Which of these statements is true? For all of them claim to be experts.

910.

Sakañhi dhammaṃ paripuṇṇamāhu, aññassa dhammaṃ pana hīnamāhu;Evampi viggayha vivādayanti, sakaṃ sakaṃ sammutimāhu saccaṃ.

For they call their own Dhamma perfect but another's Dhamma inferior. Thus they wrangle and dispute, calling their own respective conventions the truth.

911.

Parassa ce vambhayitena hīno, na koci dhammesu visesi assa;Puthū hi aññassa vadanti dhammaṃ, nihīnato samhi daḷhaṃ vadānā.

If one were made inferior by another's scorn, no one would be distinguished among the doctrines. For many call another's Dhamma inferior while speaking strongly in favor of their own.

912.

Saddhammapūjāpi nesaṃ tatheva, yathā pasaṃsanti sakāyanāni;Sabbeva vādā [sabbe pavādā (syā.)] tathiyā [tathivā (sabbattha)] bhaveyyuṃ, suddhī hi nesaṃ paccattameva.

Their veneration for the good Dhamma is just like their praise for their own paths. All their statements would be true, for their purity is a personal matter.

913.

Na brāhmaṇassa paraneyyamatthi, dhammesu niccheyya samuggahītaṃ;Tasmā vivādāni upātivatto, na hi seṭṭhato passati dhammamaññaṃ.

For a brahmin, there is nothing to be led by another, having come to a firm conclusion about the teachings. Therefore he has passed beyond disputes, for he does not see any other teaching as the best.

914.

Jānāmi passāmi tatheva etaṃ, diṭṭhiyā eke paccenti suddhiṃ;Addakkhi ce kiñhi tumassa tena, atisitvā aññena vadanti suddhiṃ.

'I know, I see, this is just so'—some find purity in a view. But even if one has seen, what is that to him? They claim purity by another means, having overstepped that.

915.

Passaṃ naro dakkhati [dakkhiti (sī.)] nāmarūpaṃ, disvāna vā ñassati tānimeva;Kāmaṃ bahuṃ passatu appakaṃ vā, na hi tena suddhiṃ kusalā vadanti.

A person who sees, sees name-and-form, and having seen them, he will know just those things. Let him see much or little, the experts do not say that purity comes through that.

916.

Nivissavādī na hi subbināyo, pakappitaṃ diṭṭhi purekkharāno;Yaṃ nissito tattha subhaṃ vadāno, suddhiṃvado tattha tathaddasā so.

A dogmatist is not easy to guide, placing his fabricated view at the forefront. Declaring as good that on which he relies, he, a proclaimer of purity, saw it thus in that.

917.

Na brāhmaṇo kappamupeti saṅkhā [saṅkhaṃ (sī. syā. pī.)], na diṭṭhisārī napi ñāṇabandhu;Ñatvā ca so sammutiyo [sammatiyo (syā.)] puthujjā, upekkhatī uggahaṇanti maññe.

A brahmin does not resort to speculation; he is not one who goes by views or is beholden to knowledge. Having known the conventions of ordinary people, he remains equanimous while others grasp.

918.

Vissajja ganthāni munīdha loke, vivādajātesu na vaggasārī;Santo asantesu upekkhako so, anuggaho uggahaṇanti maññe.

The sage, having cast off the knots here in the world, does not take sides when disputes arise. Peaceful among the unpeaceful, he is equanimous. He does not grasp, while others grasp.

919.

Pubbāsave hitvā nave akubbaṃ, na chandagū nopi nivissavādī;Sa vippamutto diṭṭhigatehi dhīro, na limpati [na lippati (sī. pī.)] loke anattagarahī.

Having abandoned former taints and not making new ones, not going by desire nor being a dogmatist, that wise one is liberated from the holdings of views. He is not stained by the world and is not self-reproachful.

920.

Sa sabbadhammesu visenibhūto, yaṃ kiñci diṭṭhaṃ va sutaṃ mutaṃ vā;Sa pannabhāro muni vippamutto, na kappiyo nūparato na patthiyoti.

He has become dispassionate towards all phenomena—whatever is seen, heard, or sensed. That sage, his burden laid down, is fully liberated. He is not fabricated, does not cease, and is not longed for.

Mahābyūhasuttaṃ terasamaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ.

The Great Discourse on the Array, the thirteenth, is concluded.
