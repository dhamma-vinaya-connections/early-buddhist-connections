# Snp 4.2 Guhaṭṭhakasuttaṃ

## Snp 4.2 On the Cave

778.

Satto guhāyaṃ bahunābhichanno, tiṭṭhaṃ naro mohanasmiṃ pagāḷho;Dūre vivekā hi tathāvidho so, kāmā hi loke na hi suppahāyā.

A being stands in the cave, shrouded by many things, plunged deep in delusion. Such a person is far from seclusion, for sensual pleasures in the world are not easy to abandon.

779.

Icchānidānā bhavasātabaddhā, te duppamuñcā na hi aññamokkhā;Pacchā pure vāpi apekkhamānā, imeva kāme purimeva jappaṃ.

Having craving as their source, bound to the delights of existence, they are hard to release and cannot be freed by another. Looking toward the future and the past, they yearn for these very sensual pleasures and for former ones.

780.

Kāmesu giddhā pasutā pamūḷhā, avadāniyā te visame niviṭṭhā;Dukkhūpanītā paridevayanti, kiṃsū bhavissāma ito cutāse.

Greedy for sensual pleasures, intent on them, and deluded, they are miserly, entrenched in the uneven. Afflicted by suffering, they lament: 'What will become of us when we pass away from here?'

781.

Tasmā hi sikkhetha idheva jantu, yaṃ kiñci jaññā visamanti loke;Na tassa hetū visamaṃ careyya, appañhidaṃ jīvitamāhu dhīrā.

Therefore a person should train right here. Whatever he might know as uneven in the world, he should not practice what is uneven for the sake of that. 'This life is short,' say the wise.

782.

Passāmi loke pariphandamānaṃ, pajaṃ imaṃ taṇhagataṃ bhavesu;Hīnā narā maccumukhe lapanti, avītataṇhāse bhavābhavesu.

I see this generation in the world trembling, in the grip of craving for states of existence. Base people lament in the mouth of death, their craving for this and that state of existence unabandoned.

783.

Mamāyite passatha phandamāne, maccheva appodake khīṇasote;Etampi disvā amamo careyya, bhavesu āsattimakubbamāno.

See them trembling over what they call 'mine,' like fish in a dwindling stream with little water. Seeing this, one should fare on without making things 'mine,' not forming an attachment to states of existence.

784.

Ubhosu antesu vineyya chandaṃ, phassaṃ pariññāya anānugiddho;Yadattagarahī tadakubbamāno, na lippatī [na limpatī (syā. ka.)] diṭṭhasutesu dhīro.

Having subdued desire for both ends, having fully understood contact and being without greed, not doing that for which he would blame himself, the wise one is not stained by what is seen and heard.

785.

Saññaṃ pariññā vitareyya oghaṃ, pariggahesu muni nopalitto;Abbūḷhasallo caramappamatto, nāsīsatī [nāsiṃsatī (sī. syā. pī.)] lokamimaṃ parañcāti.

Having fully understood perception, one should cross over the flood. The sage is not smeared by acquisitions. With dart drawn out, faring on diligently, he does not long for this world or the next.

Guhaṭṭhakasuttaṃ dutiyaṃ niṭṭhitaṃ.

The Sutta on the Cave, the second, is finished.
