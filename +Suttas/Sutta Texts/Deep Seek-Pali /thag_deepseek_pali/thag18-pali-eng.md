# Thag 18. Cattālīsanipāto
## 18. The Chapter of Eighteens

1054.
‘‘Na gaṇena purakkhato care, vimano hoti samādhi dullabho;Nānājanasaṅgaho dukho, iti disvāna gaṇaṃ na rocaye.

One should not walk about honored by a group, for the mind becomes dejected and concentration is hard to gain. Association with various people is painful—seeing this, one should not delight in a group.

1055.
‘‘Na kulāni upabbaje muni, vimano hoti samādhi dullabho;So ussukko rasānugiddho, atthaṃ riñcati yo sukhāvaho.

A sage should not frequent families, for the mind becomes dejected and concentration is hard to gain. One who is zealous and greedy for flavors relinquishes the goal that brings happiness.

1056.
‘‘Paṅkoti hi naṃ avedayuṃ, yāyaṃ vandanapūjanā kulesu;Sukhumaṃ salla durubbahaṃ, sakkāro kāpurisena dujjaho.

The wise have declared it to be mire—this homage and veneration in families. It is a subtle dart, hard to extract. Honor is hard for a base person to relinquish.

1057.
‘‘Senāsanamhā oruyha, nagaraṃ piṇḍāya pāvisiṃ;Bhuñjantaṃ purisaṃ kuṭṭhiṃ, sakkaccaṃ taṃ upaṭṭhahiṃ.

Descending from my lodging, I entered the city for alms. I respectfully approached a man with leprosy who was eating.

1058.
‘‘So me [taṃ (sī. ka.)] pakkena hatthena, ālopaṃ upanāmayi;Ālopaṃ pakkhipantassa, aṅguli cettha [pettha (sī. ka.)] chijjatha.

With his leprous hand he offered me a morsel of food. As he was placing the morsel in my bowl, a finger of his broke off right there.

1059.
‘‘Kuṭṭamūlañca [kuḍḍamūlañca (sī. syā.)] nissāya, ālopaṃ taṃ abhuñjisaṃ;Bhuñjamāne vā bhutte vā, jegucchaṃ me na vijjati.

Leaning against the base of a wall, I ate that morsel. Neither while eating it nor after having eaten was any disgust aroused in me.

1060.
‘‘Uttiṭṭhapiṇḍo āhāro, pūtimuttañca osadhaṃ;Senāsanaṃ rukkhamūlaṃ, paṃsukūlañca cīvaraṃ;Yassete abhisambhutvā [abhibhuñjati (?)], sa ve cātuddiso naro.

Gleaned scraps as food, fermented urine as medicine, the root of a tree as a lodging, and a robe from a dust-heap: whoever is content with these is truly a man of the four quarters.

1061.
‘‘Yattha eke vihaññanti, āruhantā siluccayaṃ;Tassa buddhassa dāyādo, sampajāno patissato;Iddhibalenupatthaddho, kassapo abhirūhati.

Where some are afflicted while climbing a rocky height, there the Buddha's heir, mindful and clearly comprehending, supported by psychic power, Kassapa ascends.

1062.
‘‘Piṇḍapātapaṭikkanto, selamāruyha kassapo;Jhāyati anupādāno, pahīnabhayabheravo.

Having returned from his alms round, Kassapa ascends the rock; he meditates without clinging, having abandoned fear and dread.

1063.
‘‘Piṇḍapātapaṭikkanto, selamāruyha kassapo;Jhāyati anupādāno, ḍayhamānesu nibbuto.

Having returned from his alms round, Kassapa ascends the rock; he meditates without clinging, extinguished amidst those who are burning.

1064.
‘‘Piṇḍapātapaṭikkanto, selamāruyha kassapo;Jhāyati anupādāno, katakicco anāsavo.

Having returned from his alms round, Kassapa ascends the rock; he meditates without clinging, his task done, taintless.

1065.
‘‘Karerimālāvitatā, bhūmibhāgā manoramā;Kuñjarābhirudā rammā, te selā ramayanti maṃ.

The delightful tracts of land are covered with garlands of Kareri; resounding with elephants, those lovely rocks delight me.

1066.
‘‘Nīlabbhavaṇṇā rucirā, vārisītā sucindharā;Indagopakasañchannā, te selā ramayanti maṃ.

Blue-hued and beautiful, cool with water and with clear streams, covered with Indagopaka insects, those rocks delight me.

1067.
‘‘Nīlabbhakūṭasadisā, kūṭāgāravarūpamā;Vāraṇābhirudā rammā, te selā ramayanti maṃ.

Like peaks of blue clouds, resembling excellent gabled houses, beautiful, resounding with elephants, those rocks delight me.

1068.
‘‘Abhivuṭṭhā rammatalā, nagā isibhi sevitā;Abbhunnaditā sikhīhi, te selā ramayanti maṃ.

With delightful plateaus drenched by rain, mountains frequented by seers, resounding with the cries of peacocks, those rocks delight me.

1069.
‘‘Alaṃ jhāyitukāmassa, pahitattassa me sato;Alaṃ me atthakāmassa [attakāmassa (?)], pahitattassa bhikkhuno.

Enough for me, mindful and resolute, wishing to meditate; enough for me, a resolute monk, seeking the goal.

1070.
‘‘Alaṃ me phāsukāmassa, pahitattassa bhikkhuno;Alaṃ me yogakāmassa, pahitattassa tādino.

Enough for me, a resolute monk desiring comfort; enough for me, a steadfast and resolute one, desiring application to the practice.

1071.
‘‘Umāpupphena samānā, gaganāvabbhachāditā;Nānādijagaṇākiṇṇā, te selā ramayanti maṃ.

Like flax flowers, covered by clouds in the sky, teeming with flocks of various birds, those rocks delight me.

1072.
‘‘Anākiṇṇā gahaṭṭhehi, migasaṅghanisevitā;Nānādijagaṇākiṇṇā, te selā ramayanti maṃ.

Not crowded with householders, frequented by herds of deer, teeming with flocks of various birds, those rocks delight me.

1073.
‘‘Acchodikā puthusilā, gonaṅgulamigāyutā;Ambusevālasañchannā, te selā ramayanti maṃ.

With clear water and broad rocks, frequented by gaur, langurs, and deer; covered with water-moss, those rocks delight me.

1074.
‘‘Na pañcaṅgikena turiyena, rati me hoti tādisī;Yathā ekaggacittassa, sammā dhammaṃ vipassato.

I find no such delight in the fivefold ensemble of musical instruments as I do when my mind is one-pointed, rightly seeing the Dhamma with insight.

1075.
‘‘Kammaṃ bahukaṃ na kāraye, parivajjeyya janaṃ na uyyame;Ussukko so rasānugiddho, atthaṃ riñcati yo sukhāvaho.

One should not undertake much work; one should avoid people and not be energetic. The zealous one, greedy for flavors, relinquishes the goal that brings happiness.

1076.
‘‘Kammaṃ bahukaṃ na kāraye, parivajjeyya anattaneyyametaṃ;Kicchati kāyo kilamati, dukkhito so samathaṃ na vindati.

One should not do much work; one should avoid what is not for one's own good. The body becomes troubled and weary; being afflicted by pain, one does not find tranquility.

1077.
‘‘Oṭṭhappahatamattena, attānampi na passati;Patthaddhagīvo carati, ahaṃ seyyoti maññati.

By a mere word of praise, he does not see himself; he walks about with a stiff neck, thinking, 'I am better.'

1078.
‘‘Aseyyo seyyasamānaṃ, bālo maññati attānaṃ;Na taṃ viññū pasaṃsanti, patthaddhamānasaṃ naraṃ.

Though inferior, the fool thinks himself equal to his superior; the wise do not praise that man of obstinate mind.

1079.
‘‘Yo ca seyyohamasmīti, nāhaṃ seyyoti vā pana;Hīno taṃsadiso [tīnohaṃ sadiso (syā.)] vāti, vidhāsu na vikampati.

But one who does not conceive 'I am better,' nor 'I am worse,' nor 'I am equal,' is not agitated by such distinctions.

1080.
‘‘Paññavantaṃ tathā tādiṃ, sīlesu susamāhitaṃ;Cetosamathamanuttaṃ, tañce viññū pasaṃsare.

The wise praise one who is wise and steadfast, well-composed in virtue, and who has attained supreme mental calm.

1081.
‘‘Yassa sabrahmacārīsu, gāravo nūpalabbhati;Ārakā hoti saddhammā, nabhato puthavī yathā.

One in whom no respect is found for his companions in the holy life is far from the good Dhamma, as the earth is from the sky.

1082.
‘‘Yesañca hiri ottappaṃ, sadā sammā upaṭṭhitaṃ;Virūḷhabrahmacariyā te, tesaṃ khīṇā punabbhavā.

Those in whom shame and fear of wrongdoing are always well established, their holy life has grown; for them, renewed existence is destroyed.

1083.
‘‘Uddhato capalo bhikkhu, paṃsukūlena pāruto;Kapīva sīhacammena, na so tenupasobhati.

A monk who is arrogant and fickle, though clad in a dust-heap robe, is not made beautiful by it, like a monkey in a lion's skin.

1084.
‘‘Anuddhato acapalo, nipako saṃvutindriyo;Sobhati paṃsukūlena, sīhova girigabbhare.

Not arrogant and not fickle, prudent, with restrained senses, he shines in his dust-heap robe like a lion in a mountain cave.

1085.
‘‘Ete sambahulā devā, iddhimanto yasassino;Dasadevasahassāni, sabbe te brahmakāyikā.

These are many devas, powerful and glorious, ten thousand devas, all of them of the Brahma group.

1086.
‘‘Dhammasenāpatiṃ vīraṃ, mahājhāyiṃ samāhitaṃ;Sāriputtaṃ namassantā, tiṭṭhanti pañjalīkatā. They stand with hands raised in salutation, paying homage to Sāriputta, the heroic General of the Dhamma, the great meditator, the concentrated one.


1087.
‘‘‘Namo te purisājañña, namo te purisuttama;Yassa te nābhijānāma, yampi nissāya jhāyati [jhāyasi (ka. aṭṭha.)].

“Homage to you, O noble among men! Homage to you, O highest of men! We do not know that, relying on which you meditate.”

1088.
‘‘‘Accheraṃ vata buddhānaṃ, gambhīro gocaro sako;Ye mayaṃ nābhijānāma, vālavedhisamāgatā’.

“Wonderful, indeed, is the state of the Buddhas, profound is their own domain; which we do not understand, though we are assembled like hair-splitting archers.”

1089.
‘‘Taṃ tathā devakāyehi, pūjitaṃ pūjanārahaṃ;Sāriputtaṃ tadā disvā, kappinassa sitaṃ ahu. Then, seeing Sāriputta, who is worthy of honor, being honored in that way by the host of devas, a smile arose on Kappina's face.


1090.
‘‘Yāvatā buddhakhettamhi, ṭhapayitvā mahāmuniṃ;Dhutaguṇe visiṭṭhohaṃ, sadiso me na vijjati.

Throughout the Buddha-field, excepting the Great Sage, I am pre-eminent in the ascetic qualities; there is no one equal to me.

1091.
‘‘Pariciṇṇo mayā satthā, kataṃ buddhassa sāsanaṃ;Ohito garuko bhāro, natthi dāni punabbhavo.

The Teacher has been served by me, the Buddha's teaching has been fulfilled. The heavy burden is laid down, there is now no more renewed existence.

1092.
‘‘Na cīvare na sayane, bhojane nupalimpati;Gotamo anappameyyo, muḷālapupphaṃ vimalaṃva;Ambunā nekkhammaninno, tibhavābhinissaṭo.

He is not sullied by robes, lodging, or food, Gotama the immeasurable, just as a spotless lotus is not sullied by water. Inclined to renunciation, he has escaped from the three states of existence.

1093.
‘‘Satipaṭṭhānagīvo so, saddhāhattho mahāmuni;Paññāsīso mahāñāṇī, sadā carati nibbuto’’ti.

That Great Sage has the foundations of mindfulness for a neck, faith for hands, and wisdom for a head; greatly wise, he always fares extinguished. … Mahākassapo thero…. … The Elder Mahākassapa … Cattālīsanipāto niṭṭhito. The Chapter of the Forties is finished. Tatruddānaṃ – The summary: Cattālīsanipātamhi, mahākassapasavhayo;Ekova thero gāthāyo, cattāsīla duvepi cāti. In the Chapter of the Forties, the elder named Mahākassapa is the only one; the verses are forty and two.
