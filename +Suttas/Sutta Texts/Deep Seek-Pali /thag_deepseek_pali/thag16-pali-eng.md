# Thag 16. Vīsatinipāto
## 16. The Chapter of Sixteens

705.
‘‘Yaññatthaṃ vā dhanatthaṃ vā, ye hanāma mayaṃ pure;Avasesaṃ [avase taṃ (sī. aṭṭha. mūlapāṭho), avasesānaṃ (aṭṭha.?)] bhayaṃ hoti, vedhanti vilapanti ca.

“For the sake of sacrifice or for wealth, those whom we formerly killed—on their account fear remains; they cause us anguish and they lament.

706.
‘‘Tassa te natthi bhītattaṃ, bhiyyo vaṇṇo pasīdati;Kasmā na paridevesi, evarūpe mahabbhaye.

“But you show no sign of fear; your complexion brightens all the more. Why do you not grieve in the face of such great peril?”

707.
‘‘Natthi cetasikaṃ dukkhaṃ, anapekkhassa gāmaṇi;Atikkantā bhayā sabbe, khīṇasaṃyojanassa ve.

“There is no mental suffering, chieftain, for one who is without expectations. All fears have been transcended by one whose fetters are destroyed.

708.
‘‘Khīṇāya bhavanettiyā, diṭṭhe dhamme yathātathe;Na bhayaṃ maraṇe hoti, bhāranikkhepane yathā.

“When the guide to existence is destroyed, and one has seen the Dhamma in this very life as it really is, there is no fear at death, just like laying down a burden.

709.
‘‘Suciṇṇaṃ brahmacariyaṃ me, maggo cāpi subhāvito;Maraṇe me bhayaṃ natthi, rogānamiva saṅkhaye.

“The holy life has been well lived by me, and the path has been well developed. I have no fear of death, just as one has no fear of the wasting away of diseases.

710.
‘‘Suciṇṇaṃ brahmacariyaṃ me, maggo cāpi subhāvito;Nirassādā bhavā diṭṭhā, visaṃ pitvāva [pītvāva (sī.)] chaḍḍitaṃ.

“The holy life has been well lived by me, and the path has been well developed. States of existence are seen as without gratification, like poison that one has drunk and then vomited.

711.
‘‘Pāragū anupādāno, katakicco anāsavo;Tuṭṭho āyukkhayā hoti, mutto āghātanā yathā.

“One who has gone to the far shore, without clinging, his duty done, taintless, is content at the end of his life-span, like one freed from the execution block.

712.
‘‘Uttamaṃ dhammataṃ patto, sabbaloke anatthiko;Ādittāva gharā mutto, maraṇasmiṃ na socati.

“Having attained the supreme nature of the Dhamma, needing nothing in the entire world, like one freed from a burning house, one does not grieve at death.

713.
‘‘Yadatthi saṅgataṃ kiñci, bhavo vā yattha labbhati;Sabbaṃ anissaraṃ etaṃ, iti vuttaṃ mahesinā.

“Whatever has been brought together, or wherever existence is found, all this is without a master—so it has been said by the Great Seer.

714.
‘‘Yo taṃ tathā pajānāti, yathā buddhena desitaṃ;Na gaṇhāti bhavaṃ kiñci, sutattaṃva ayoguḷaṃ.

“One who understands this as it is, just as it was taught by the Buddha, does not grasp at any existence, just as one would not grasp a red-hot iron ball.

715.
‘‘Na me hoti ‘ahosi’nti, ‘bhavissa’nti na hoti me;Saṅkhārā vigamissanti, tattha kā paridevanā.

“For me there is no thought ‘I was,’ nor is there for me ‘I will be.’ Formations will cease: what lamentation can there be in that?

716.
‘‘Suddhaṃ dhammasamuppādaṃ, suddhaṃ saṅkhārasantatiṃ;Passantassa yathābhūtaṃ, na bhayaṃ hoti gāmaṇi.

“For one who sees as it really is the pure origination of phenomena and the pure continuity of formations, there is no fear, O chieftain.

717.
‘‘Tiṇakaṭṭhasamaṃ lokaṃ, yadā paññāya passati;Mamattaṃ so asaṃvindaṃ, ‘natthi me’ti na socati.

“When with wisdom one sees the world to be like grass and sticks, finding no ‘mineness’ there, one does not grieve with the thought, ‘I have nothing.’

718.
‘‘Ukkaṇṭhāmi sarīrena, bhavenamhi anatthiko;Soyaṃ bhijjissati kāyo, añño ca na bhavissati.

“I am weary of this body; I have no need for existence. This body will break up, and there will be no other.

719.
‘‘Yaṃ vo kiccaṃ sarīrena, taṃ karotha yadicchatha;Na me tappaccayā tattha, doso pemañca hehiti’’.

“Whatever you have to do with this body, do as you wish; on that account neither aversion nor affection will arise in me.”

720.
Tassa taṃ vacanaṃ sutvā, abbhutaṃ lomahaṃsanaṃ;Satthāni nikkhipitvāna, māṇavā etadabravuṃ.

Having heard his words, so amazing and hair-raising, the young men laid down their weapons and spoke thus:

721.
‘‘Kiṃ bhadante karitvāna, ko vā ācariyo tava;Kassa sāsanamāgamma, labbhate taṃ asokatā’’.

“Venerable sir, what have you done? Who is your teacher? By relying on whose teaching is this sorrowless state attained?”

722.
‘‘Sabbaññū sabbadassāvī, jino ācariyo mama;Mahākāruṇiko satthā, sabbalokatikicchako.

“The All-knower, the All-seer, the Victor is my teacher; the greatly compassionate Teacher, the physician for the entire world.

723.
‘‘Tenāyaṃ desito dhammo, khayagāmī anuttaro;Tassa sāsanamāgamma, labbhate taṃ asokatā’’.

“By him this Dhamma has been taught, unsurpassed, leading to destruction. By relying on his teaching, this sorrowless state is attained.”

724.
Sutvāna corā isino subhāsitaṃ, nikkhippa satthāni ca āvudhāni ca;Tamhā ca kammā viramiṃsu eke, eke ca pabbajjamarocayiṃsu.

Having heard the seer’s well-spoken words, the thieves laid down their knives and their weapons; some desisted from that deed, while others chose the going forth.

725.
Te pabbajitvā sugatassa sāsane, bhāvetva bojjhaṅgabalāni paṇḍitā;Udaggacittā sumanā katindriyā, phusiṃsu nibbānapadaṃ asaṅkhatanti. Having gone forth in the Well-farer’s dispensation, those wise ones developed the enlightenment factors and the spiritual powers. With minds uplifted, joyful, their faculties guarded, they attained the unconditioned state, Nibbāna.

…Adhimutto thero…. … The Elder Adhimutta … 2. Pārāpariyattheragāthā 2.The Verses of the Elder Pārāpariya

726.
‘‘Samaṇassa ahu cintā, pārāpariyassa bhikkhuno;Ekakassa nisinnassa, pavivittassa jhāyino. A thought occurred to the bhikkhu Pārāpariya, as he was sitting alone in seclusion, meditating:


727.
‘‘Kimānupubbaṃ puriso, kiṃ vataṃ kiṃ samācāraṃ;Attano kiccakārīssa, na ca kañci viheṭhaye.

“What, in sequence, should a person do? What vow and what conduct should he have, so that in doing his own task he would harm no one?

728.
‘‘Indriyāni manussānaṃ, hitāya ahitāya ca;Arakkhitāni ahitāya, rakkhitāni hitāya ca.

“The faculties of humans are for their welfare and for their harm; unguarded, they are for their harm, but guarded, they are for their welfare.

729.
‘‘Indriyāneva sārakkhaṃ, indriyāni ca gopayaṃ;Attano kiccakārīssa, na ca kañci viheṭhaye.

“One should indeed guard the faculties, and protecting the faculties, one does one’s own task and harms no one.

730.
‘‘Cakkhundriyaṃ ce rūpesu, gacchantaṃ anivārayaṃ;Anādīnavadassāvī, so dukkhā na hi muccati.

“If one does not restrain the eye faculty as it ranges among forms, not seeing the danger in them, one is not freed from suffering.

731.
‘‘Sotindriyaṃ ce saddesu, gacchantaṃ anivārayaṃ;Anādīnavadassāvī, so dukkhā na hi muccati.

“If one does not restrain the ear faculty as it ranges among sounds, not seeing the danger in them, one is not freed from suffering.

732.
‘‘Anissaraṇadassāvī, gandhe ce paṭisevati;Na so muccati dukkhamhā, gandhesu adhimucchito.

“If one partakes of scents without seeing the escape, one is not freed from suffering, being infatuated with scents.

733.
‘‘Ambilaṃ madhuraggañca, tittakaggamanussaraṃ;Rasataṇhāya gadhito, hadayaṃ nāvabujjhati.

“Remembering the sour, the choicest sweet, and the choicest bitter, being greedy with craving for tastes, one’s heart does not awaken.

734.
‘‘Subhānyappaṭikūlāni, phoṭṭhabbāni anussaraṃ;Ratto rāgādhikaraṇaṃ, vividhaṃ vindate dukhaṃ.

“Remembering beautiful and agreeable tangible objects, one becomes impassioned; on account of lust one experiences manifold suffering.

735.
‘‘Manaṃ cetehi dhammehi, yo na sakkoti rakkhituṃ;Tato naṃ dukkhamanveti, sabbehetehi pañcahi.

“Whoever is unable to guard the mind from these phenomena, suffering follows them on account of all these five.

736.
‘‘Pubbalohitasampuṇṇaṃ, bahussa kuṇapassa ca;Naravīrakataṃ vagguṃ, samuggamiva cittitaṃ.

“Filled with pus, blood, and much carrion, made lovely by a ‘hero among men,’ like a decorated casket.

737.
‘‘Kaṭukaṃ madhurassādaṃ, piyanibandhanaṃ dukhaṃ;Khuraṃva madhunā littaṃ, ullihaṃ nāvabujjhati.

“Bitter, with a sweet taste, a painful binder to what is dear—like a razor smeared with honey, one licks it but does not understand.

738.
‘‘Itthirūpe itthisare, phoṭṭhabbepi ca itthiyā;Itthigandhesu sāratto, vividhaṃ vindate dukhaṃ.

“Attached to a woman’s form, her voice, and her touch, and captivated by her scents, one experiences manifold suffering.

739.
‘‘Itthisotāni sabbāni, sandanti pañca pañcasu;Tesamāvaraṇaṃ kātuṃ, yo sakkoti vīriyavā.

“All the streams of sensual lure from a woman flow through the five sense faculties; the energetic one is he who can construct a barrier against them.

740.
‘‘So atthavā so dhammaṭṭho, so dakkho so vicakkhaṇo;Kareyya ramamānopi, kiccaṃ dhammatthasaṃhitaṃ.

“He has a purpose, is established in the Dhamma, is skilled and discerning; even while taking delight, he would do the task connected with the goal and the Dhamma.

741.
‘‘Atho sīdati saññuttaṃ, vajje kiccaṃ niratthakaṃ;‘Na taṃ kicca’nti maññitvā, appamatto vicakkhaṇo.

“One who is attached sinks down. A heedful and discerning one should avoid a useless task, recognizing, ‘That is not my duty.’

742.
‘‘Yañca atthena saññuttaṃ, yā ca dhammagatā rati;Taṃ samādāya vattetha, sā hi ve uttamā rati.

“Whatever is connected with the goal, and whatever delight is rooted in the Dhamma—one should undertake that and live by it, for that is truly the supreme delight.

743.
‘‘Uccāvacehupāyehi, paresamabhijigīsati;Hantvā vadhitvā atha socayitvā, ālopati sāhasā yo paresaṃ.

“By various means one seeks to conquer others; having struck them, killed them, and caused them to grieve, one violently plunders them.

744.
‘‘Tacchanto āṇiyā āṇiṃ, nihanti balavā yathā;Indriyānindriyeheva, nihanti kusalo tathā.

“As a strong man drives out one peg with another, so the skilled one subdues one faculty with another.

745.
‘‘Saddhaṃ vīriyaṃ samādhiñca, satipaññañca bhāvayaṃ;Pañca pañcahi hantvāna, anīgho yāti brāhmaṇo.

“By developing faith, energy, concentration, mindfulness, and wisdom, and having slain the five with the five, the brahmin proceeds free from trouble.

746.
‘‘So atthavā so dhammaṭṭho, katvā vākyānusāsaniṃ;Sabbena sabbaṃ buddhassa, so naro sukhamedhatī’’ti.

“He is one with purpose, established in the Dhamma, having followed the instruction in the word of the Buddha; in every way that person prospers in happiness.” …Pārāpariyo thero…. … The Elder Pārāpariya … 3. Telakānittheragāthā 3.The Verses of the Elder Telakāni

747.
‘‘Cirarattaṃ vatātāpī, dhammaṃ anuvicintayaṃ;Samaṃ cittassa nālatthaṃ, pucchaṃ samaṇabrāhmaṇe.

“For a long time, indeed, I was strenuous, reflecting on the Dhamma, yet I did not attain peace of mind. I asked ascetics and brahmins:

748.
‘‘‘Ko so pāraṅgato loke, ko patto amatogadhaṃ;Kassa dhammaṃ paṭicchāmi, paramatthavijānanaṃ’.

“‘Who in the world has gone to the far shore? Who has attained the Deathless? Whose Dhamma should I accept to know the ultimate truth?’

749.
‘‘Antovaṅkagato āsi, macchova ghasamāmisaṃ;Baddho mahindapāsena, vepacityasuro yathā.

“I was caught inside a fish-weir, like a fish that has swallowed the bait; bound by the snare of the great Indra, just as was the asura Vepacitti.

750.
‘‘Añchāmi naṃ na muñcāmi, asmā sokapariddavā;Ko me bandhaṃ muñcaṃ loke, sambodhiṃ vedayissati.

“I pull at it, I do not let it go, from this sorrow and lamentation. Who in the world can loosen my bond and lead me to know enlightenment?

751.
‘‘Samaṇaṃ brāhmaṇaṃ vā kaṃ, ādisantaṃ pabhaṅgunaṃ.Kassa dhammaṃ paṭicchāmi, jarāmaccupavāhanaṃ.

“What ascetic or brahmin can point out the transient nature of things? Whose Dhamma should I accept to be conveyed beyond old age and death?

752.
‘‘Vicikicchākaṅkhāganthitaṃ, sārambhabalasaññutaṃ;Kodhappattamanatthaddhaṃ, abhijappappadāraṇaṃ.

“Knotted by doubt and uncertainty, yoked to the force of contention; afflicted by anger, mentally rigid, torn apart by craving.

753.
‘‘Taṇhādhanusamuṭṭhānaṃ, dve ca pannarasāyutaṃ [dvedhāpannarasāyutaṃ (?)];Passa orasikaṃ bāḷhaṃ, bhetvāna yadi [yada (sī. aṭṭha.) hadi (?) ‘‘hadaye’’ti taṃsaṃvaṇṇanā] tiṭṭhati.

“See the powerful dart lodged in the breast, sprung from the bow of craving, endowed with seventeen points. If, having pierced, it remains…

754.
‘‘Anudiṭṭhīnaṃ appahānaṃ, saṅkappaparatejitaṃ;Tena viddho pavedhāmi, pattaṃva māluteritaṃ.

“Not having abandoned my speculative views, inflamed by intentions, I am pierced by that dart and tremble, like a leaf struck by the wind.

755.
‘‘Ajjhattaṃ me samuṭṭhāya, khippaṃ paccati māmakaṃ;Chaphassāyatanī kāyo, yattha sarati sabbadā.

“Arising from within me, it quickly torments what I call ‘mine’—this body with its six sense bases, where the mind constantly wanders.

756.
‘‘Taṃ na passāmi tekicchaṃ, yo metaṃ sallamuddhare;Nānārajjena satthena [nāraggena na satthena (?)], nāññena vicikicchitaṃ.

“I see no physician who could extract this dart for me; not by sovereignty and a weapon, nor by any other dubious means.

757.
‘‘Ko me asattho avaṇo, sallamabbhantarapassayaṃ;Ahiṃsaṃ sabbagattāni, sallaṃ me uddharissati.

“Who, without a knife and without inflicting a wound, not harming any of my limbs, will extract this dart of mine lodged deep within?

758.
‘‘Dhammappati hi so seṭṭho, visadosappavāhako;Gambhīre patitassa me, thalaṃ pāṇiñca dassaye.

“For he, the Lord of the Dhamma, is the best, the remover of the poison of corruption. For me, who had fallen into the deep, he showed dry land and a helping hand.

759.
‘‘Rahadehamasmi ogāḷho, ahāriyarajamattike;Māyāusūyasārambha, thinamiddhamapatthaṭe.

“I was plunged into the lake of the body, into the irremovable mud and dust, where deceit, envy, contention, sloth, and torpor were spread about.

760.
‘‘Uddhaccameghathanitaṃ, saṃyojanavalāhakaṃ;Vāhā vahanti kuddiṭṭhiṃ [duddiṭṭhiṃ (sī. dha. pa. 339)], saṅkappā rāganissitā.

“Restlessness is the thunder of the clouds, the fetters are the storm clouds; torrents carry along wrong views, and intentions are dependent on lust.

761.
‘‘Savanti sabbadhi sotā, latā ubbhijja tiṭṭhati;Te sote ko nivāreyya, taṃ lataṃ ko hi checchati.

“Streams flow everywhere; a creeper sprouts and stands fast. Who can hold back those streams? Who indeed will cut that creeper?

762.
‘‘Velaṃ karotha bhaddante, sotānaṃ sannivāraṇaṃ;Mā te manomayo soto, rukkhaṃva sahasā luve.

“Venerable Sir, build a dam to hold back the streams, lest the mind-made current should violently cut you down like a tree.

763.
‘‘Evaṃ me bhayajātassa, apārā pāramesato;Tāṇo paññāvudho satthā, isisaṅghanisevito.

“Thus for me, who was overcome by fear, seeking the far shore from the near, the Teacher was a shelter, armed with wisdom, attended by the assembly of seers.

764.
‘‘Sopāṇaṃ sugataṃ suddhaṃ, dhammasāramayaṃ daḷhaṃ;Pādāsi vuyhamānassa, ‘mā bhāyī’ti ca mabravi.

“He gave me a well-made, pure, firm stairway, made of the essence of the Dhamma, as I was being swept away, and he said to me, ‘Do not fear!’

765.
‘‘Satipaṭṭhānapāsādaṃ, āruyha paccavekkhisaṃ;Yaṃ taṃ pubbe amaññissaṃ, sakkāyābhirataṃ pajaṃ.

“Having ascended the palace of the foundations of mindfulness, I looked down upon the people who delight in their personal identity, a state I formerly esteemed.

766.
‘‘Yadā ca maggamaddakkhiṃ, nāvāya abhirūhanaṃ;Anadhiṭṭhāya attānaṃ, titthamaddakkhimuttamaṃ.

“And when I saw the path—the embarking upon the ship—without taking a stand on self, I beheld the supreme ford.

767.
‘‘Sallaṃ attasamuṭṭhānaṃ, bhavanettippabhāvitaṃ;Etesaṃ appavattāya [appavattiyā (?)], desesi maggamuttamaṃ.

“For the non-occurrence of this dart—arisen from oneself and produced by the guide to existence—He taught the supreme path.

768.
‘‘Dīgharattānusayitaṃ, cirarattamadhiṭṭhitaṃ;Buddho mepānudī ganthaṃ, visadosappavāhano’’ti.

“That which had long lain latent, that which had long been established—the Buddha, the remover of the poison of corruption, has driven out that bond of mine.” …Telakāni thero…. … The Elder Telakāni … 4. Raṭṭhapālattheragāthā 4.The Verses of the Elder Raṭṭhapāla

769.
[ma. ni. 2.302] ‘‘Passa cittakataṃ bimbaṃ, arukāyaṃ samussitaṃ;Āturaṃ bahusaṅkappaṃ, yassa natthi dhuvaṃ ṭhiti.

“Behold this decorated image, a heap of sores piled up, diseased, an object of many thoughts, for which there is no lasting stability.

770.
‘‘Passa cittakataṃ rūpaṃ, maṇinā kuṇḍalena ca;Aṭṭhiṃ tacena onaddhaṃ, saha vatthehi sobhati.

“Behold this decorated form, with its jewel and earring; a skeleton bound with skin, it shines together with its clothes.

771.
‘‘Alattakakatā pādā, mukhaṃ cuṇṇakamakkhitaṃ;Alaṃ bālassa mohāya, no ca pāragavesino.

“Feet dyed with lac, a face smeared with powder: enough to delude a fool, but not one who seeks the far shore.

772.
‘‘Aṭṭhapadakatā kesā, nettā añjanamakkhitā;Alaṃ bālassa mohāya, no ca pāragavesino.

“Hair done in eightfold braids, eyes smeared with collyrium: enough to delude a fool, but not one who seeks the far shore.

773.
‘‘Añjanīva navā cittā, pūtikāyo alaṅkato;Alaṃ bālassa mohāya, no ca pāragavesino.

“This putrid body, all adorned, is like a freshly painted casket: enough to delude a fool, but not one who seeks the far shore.

774.
‘‘Odahi migavo pāsaṃ, nāsadā vāguraṃ migo;Bhutvā nivāpaṃ gacchāma, kandante migabandhake.

“The hunter set his snare, but the deer did not approach the net. Having eaten the bait, we depart, while the deer-trapper laments.

775.
‘‘Chinno pāso migavassa, nāsadā vāguraṃ migo;Bhutvā nivāpaṃ gacchāma, socante migaluddake.

“The hunter’s snare is cut, the deer did not approach the net. Having eaten the bait, we depart, while the deer-hunter grieves.

776.
‘‘Passāmi loke sadhane manusse, laddhāna vittaṃ na dadanti mohā;Luddhā dhanaṃ sannicayaṃ karonti, bhiyyova kāme abhipatthayanti.

“I see wealthy people in the world who, having acquired riches, do not give because of delusion. Greedily they accumulate wealth and long for sensual pleasures all the more.

777.
‘‘Rājā pasayhappathaviṃ vijetvā, sasāgarantaṃ mahimāvasanto;Oraṃ samuddassa atittarūpo, pāraṃ samuddassapi patthayetha.

“A king who has conquered the earth by force and rules it to the ocean’s shore, still unsatisfied with the near shore of the sea, would long for the far shore too.

778.
‘‘Rājā ca aññe ca bahū manussā, avītataṇhā maraṇaṃ upenti;Ūnāva hutvāna jahanti dehaṃ, kāmehi lokamhi na hatthi titti.

“A king and many other people approach death with craving unallayed; still wanting, they give up the body, for in the world there is no satisfaction in sensual pleasures.

779.
‘‘Kandanti naṃ ñātī pakiriya kese, aho vatā no amarāti cāhu;Vatthena naṃ pārutaṃ nīharitvā, citaṃ samodhāya tato ḍahanti.

“His kinsmen weep for him with dishevelled hair, crying, ‘Alas, he is not immortal!’ Having wrapped him in a cloth, they carry him out, and placing him on a pyre, they burn him.

780.
‘‘So ḍayhati sūlehi tujjamāno, ekena vatthena [etena gatthena (ka.)] pahāya bhoge;Na mīyamānassa bhavanti tāṇā, ñātī ca mittā atha vā sahāyā.

“He is burned, prodded with stakes, having left his possessions behind with but a single cloth. For the one who is dying there are no protectors: no kinsmen, no friends or companions.

781.
‘‘Dāyādakā tassa dhanaṃ haranti, satto pana gacchati yena kammaṃ;Na mīyamānaṃ dhanamanveti [manviti (ka.)] kiñci, puttā ca dārā ca dhanañca raṭṭhaṃ.

“His heirs carry off his wealth, while the being fares on according to his kamma. Nothing follows the one who is dying: not children, wife, wealth, or kingdom.

782.
‘‘Na dīghamāyuṃ labhate dhanena, na cāpi vittena jaraṃ vihanti;Appappaṃ hidaṃ jīvitamāhu dhīrā, asassataṃ vippariṇāmadhammaṃ.

“One does not gain long life with wealth, nor does one fend off old age with riches. The wise say this life is short, non-eternal, and subject to change.

783.
‘‘Aḍḍhā daliddā ca phusanti phassaṃ, bālo ca dhīro ca tatheva phuṭṭho;Bālo hi bālyā vadhitova seti, dhīro ca no vedhati phassaphuṭṭho.

“The rich and the poor experience contact; the fool and the wise are likewise touched. But the fool, through his folly, lies as if slain, while the wise one, though touched by contact, does not tremble.

784.
‘‘Tasmā hi paññāva dhanena seyyā, yāya vosānamidhādhigacchati;Abyositattā hi bhavābhavesu, pāpāni kammāni karoti mohā.

“Therefore wisdom is surely better than wealth, for by it one reaches the consummation here. Not having reached the consummation, one does evil deeds in life after life because of delusion.

785.
‘‘Upeti gabbhañca parañca lokaṃ, saṃsāramāpajja paramparāya;Tassappapañño abhisaddahanto, upeti gabbhañca parañca lokaṃ.

“One enters a womb and the next world, falling into the round of rebirths in succession. One of little wisdom, placing faith in this, enters a womb and the next world.

786.
‘‘Coro yathā sandhimukhe gahīto, sakammunā haññati pāpadhammo;Evaṃ pajā pecca paramhi loke, sakammunā haññati pāpadhammo.

“Just as a thief of evil ways, caught at the breach, is made to suffer for his own deed, so people of evil ways, after passing away, are made to suffer in the next world for their own deeds.

787.
‘‘Kāmā hi citrā madhurā manoramā, virūparūpena mathenti cittaṃ;Ādīnavaṃ kāmaguṇesu disvā, tasmā ahaṃ pabbajitomhi rāja.

“Sensual pleasures, varied, sweet, and delightful, churn the mind with their manifold forms. Having seen the danger in the strands of sensual pleasure, O king, I have therefore gone forth.

788.
‘‘Dumapphalānīva patanti māṇavā, daharā ca vuḍḍhā ca sarīrabhedā;Etampi disvā pabbajitomhi rāja, apaṇṇakaṃ sāmaññameva seyyo.

“Like fruits from a tree, people fall, both young and old, when their bodies break up. Seeing this too, O king, I have gone forth; the ascetic life is definitely the better, the certain path.”

789.
‘‘Saddhāyāhaṃ pabbajito, upeto jinasāsane;Avajjhā mayhaṃ pabbajjā, anaṇo bhuñjāmi bhojanaṃ.

“I have gone forth out of faith, having entered the Victor’s Dispensation. My going forth is not in vain; I eat my almsfood free of debt.

790.
‘‘Kāme ādittato disvā, jātarūpāni satthato;Gabbhavokkantito dukkhaṃ, nirayesu mahabbhayaṃ.

“Seeing sensual pleasures as ablaze, gold as a knife, the descent into the womb as suffering, and great fear in the hells—

791.
‘‘Etamādīnavaṃ ñatvā, saṃvegaṃ alabhiṃ tadā;Sohaṃ viddho tadā santo, sampatto āsavakkhayaṃ.

“Having known this danger, I then found a sense of urgency. Pierced by that, I, being at peace, have attained the destruction of the taints.

792.
‘‘Pariciṇṇo mayā satthā, kataṃ buddhassa sāsanaṃ;Ohito garuko bhāro, bhavanetti samūhatā.

“The Teacher has been served by me, the Buddha’s teaching has been done; the heavy burden is laid down, the conduit to existence is removed.

793.
‘‘Yassatthāya pabbajito, agārasmānagāriyaṃ;So me attho anuppatto, sabbasaṃyojanakkhayo’’ti.

Formerly I was of brahmin birth, of high lineage on both sides. Today I am a son of the Well-Gone One, the Teacher, the King of Dhamma.

890.
‘‘Vītataṇho anādāno, guttadvāro susaṃvuto;Aghamūlaṃ vadhitvāna, patto me āsavakkhayo.

Without craving, without grasping, with guarded sense doors, well restrained, having cut off the root of evil, I have attained the destruction of the taints.

891.
‘‘Pariciṇṇo mayā satthā, kataṃ buddhassa sāsanaṃ;Ohito garuko bhāro, bhavanetti samūhatā’’ti.

The Teacher has been served by me, the Buddha’s teaching has been done; the heavy burden has been laid down, the guide to existence has been uprooted. … Aṅgulimālo thero…. … The Elder Aṅgulimāla … 9. Anuruddhattheragāthā 9.The Verses of the Elder Anuruddha

892.
‘‘Pahāya mātāpitaro, bhaginī ñātibhātaro;Pañca kāmaguṇe hitvā, anuruddhova jhāyatu.

Having left behind mother and father, sisters, kinsmen, and brothers; having abandoned the five strands of sensual pleasure, let Anuruddha meditate.

893.
‘‘Sameto naccagītehi, sammatāḷappabodhano;Na tena suddhimajjhagaṃ [suddhamajjhagā (sī. ka.), suddhimajjhagamā (syā.)], mārassa visaye rato. Accompanied by dance and song, and awakened by the sound of clapping, I did not attain purity by that, for I delighted in Māra’s domain.


894.
‘‘Etañca samatikkamma, rato buddhassa sāsane;Sabboghaṃ samatikkamma, anuruddhova jhāyati.

But having transcended this, delighting in the Buddha’s teaching, having crossed over all the floods, Anuruddha meditates.

895.
‘‘Rūpā saddā rasā gandhā, phoṭṭhabbā ca manoramā;Ete ca samatikkamma, anuruddhova jhāyati.

Forms, sounds, tastes, and smells, and tangible objects so delightful—having overcome these as well, Anuruddha meditates.

896.
‘‘Piṇḍapātapaṭikkanto, eko adutiyo muni;Esati paṃsukūlāni, anuruddho anāsavo.

Returned from his alms round, the sage alone, without a companion, Anuruddha, the taintless one, seeks out dust-heap robes.

897.
‘‘Vicinī aggahī dhovi, rajayī dhārayī muni;Paṃsukūlāni matimā, anuruddho anāsavo.

The wise sage Anuruddha, the taintless one, selected, took, washed, dyed, and wore the dust-heap robes.

898.
‘‘Mahiccho ca asantuṭṭho, saṃsaṭṭho yo ca uddhato;Tassa dhammā ime honti, pāpakā saṃkilesikā.

For one of great ambition and discontent, who is sociable and arrogant, these are evil, defiling qualities.

899.
‘‘Sato ca hoti appiccho, santuṭṭho avighātavā;Pavivekarato vitto, niccamāraddhavīriyo.

But one who is mindful and of few wishes, content and untroubled, delighting in seclusion, joyful, with energy ever aroused—

900.
‘‘Tassa dhammā ime honti, kusalā bodhipakkhikā;Anāsavo ca so hoti, iti vuttaṃ mahesinā.

For him these qualities are wholesome, aids to enlightenment; and he is taintless—so it was said by the Great Sage.

901.
‘‘Mama saṅkappamaññāya, satthā loke anuttaro;Manomayena kāyena, iddhiyā upasaṅkami.

Knowing my intention, the Teacher, unsurpassed in the world, approached me by psychic power with a mind-made body.

902.
‘‘Yadā me ahu saṅkappo, tato uttari desayi;Nippapañcarato buddho, nippapañcamadesayi.

When that thought arose in me, he taught what is still higher. The Buddha, who delights in non-proliferation, taught about non-proliferation.

903.
‘‘Tassāhaṃ dhammamaññāya, vihāsiṃ sāsane rato;Tisso vijjā anuppattā, kataṃ buddhassa sāsanaṃ.

Having understood his Dhamma, I dwelt delighting in the Dispensation. The three true knowledges have been attained; the Buddha’s teaching has been done.

904.
‘‘Pañcapaññāsavassāni, yato nesajjiko ahaṃ;Pañcavīsativassāni, yato middhaṃ samūhataṃ.

For fifty-five years I have maintained the sitter's posture; for twenty-five years drowsiness has been uprooted.

905.
[dī. ni. 2.222] ‘‘Nāhu assāsapassāsā, ṭhitacittassa tādino;Anejo santimārabbha, cakkhumā parinibbuto. For the Suchlike One of steadfast mind, there were no in-breaths and out-breaths. Unshaken, intent on peace, the One with Vision has attained final Nibbāna.


906.
[dī. ni. 2.222] ‘‘Asallīnena cittena, vedanaṃ ajjhavāsayi;Pajjotasseva nibbānaṃ, vimokkho cetaso ahu.

With an unshrinking mind he endured the feeling. Like the extinguishing of a lamp was the liberation of his mind.

907.
‘‘Ete pacchimakā dāni, munino phassapañcamā;Nāññe dhammā bhavissanti, sambuddhe parinibbute. These now are the sage’s final phenomena, the five headed by contact; there will be no further conditioned states when the Perfectly Enlightened One has attained final Nibbāna.


908.
‘‘Natthi dāni punāvāso, devakāyasmi jālini;Vikkhīṇo jātisaṃsāro, natthi dāni punabbhavo. There is now no more dwelling, Jālinī, in the host of devas. The round of births is destroyed; there is now no more renewed existence.


909.
‘‘Yassa muhuttena sahassadhā, loko saṃvidito sabrahmakappo;Vasī iddhiguṇe cutūpapāte, kāle passati devatā sa bhikkhu [sabhikkhuno (sī. ka.)].

That bhikkhu is a master of the qualities of psychic power and of the passing away and rebirth of beings; at the proper time he sees the devas. In a moment a thousandfold world system, together with the Brahma world, is fully known to him.

910.
‘‘Annabhāro [annahāro (sī.)] pure āsiṃ, daliddo ghāsahārako;Samaṇaṃ paṭipādesiṃ, upariṭṭhaṃ yasassinaṃ. In the past I was Annabhāra, a poor grass-carrier. I served a recluse, the famous Uparittha.


911.
‘‘Somhi sakyakule jāto, anuruddhoti maṃ vidū;Upeto naccagītehi, sammatāḷappabodhano.

I was born in the Sakyan clan; they know me as Anuruddha. I was attended by dance and song, awakened by the sound of clapping.

912.
‘‘Athaddasāsiṃ sambuddhaṃ, satthāraṃ akutobhayaṃ;Tasmiṃ cittaṃ pasādetvā, pabbajiṃ anagāriyaṃ.

Then I saw the Perfectly Enlightened One, the Teacher who is fearless from any quarter. Having gained confidence in him, I went forth into the homeless life.

913.
‘‘Pubbenivāsaṃ jānāmi, yattha me vusitaṃ pure;Tāvatiṃsesu devesu, aṭṭhāsiṃ sakkajātiyā [satajātiyā (sī.)]. I know my past abodes, where I have lived before; I stood among the Tāvatiṃsa gods, having been born as Sakka.


914.
‘‘Sattakkhattuṃ manussindo, ahaṃ rajjamakārayiṃ;Cāturanto vijitāvī, jambusaṇḍassa issaro;Adaṇḍena asatthena, dhammena anusāsayiṃ. Seven times I was a king of humans and exercised sovereignty, a conqueror of the four quarters, lord of Jambudīpa. Without rod or sword, I governed righteously.


915.
‘‘Ito satta tato satta, saṃsārāni catuddasa;Nivāsamabhijānissaṃ, devaloke ṭhitā tadā.

Seven lives here and seven there—fourteen transmigrations in all; I came to know my dwelling place when I was established then in the deva world.

916.
‘‘Pañcaṅgike samādhimhi, sante ekodibhāvite;Paṭippassaddhiladdhamhi, dibbacakkhu visujjhi me.

In the five-factored concentration—peaceful, unified, and developed, where tranquility had been gained—my divine eye was purified.

917.
‘‘Cutūpapātaṃ jānāmi, sattānaṃ āgatiṃ gatiṃ;Itthabhāvaññathābhāvaṃ, jhāne pañcaṅgike ṭhito. Established in the five-factored jhāna, I know the passing away and rebirth of beings, their coming and going, and their state of being thus or otherwise.


918.
‘‘Pariciṇṇo mayā satthā…pe… bhavanetti samūhatā.

The Teacher has been served by me… the conduit to existence is uprooted.

919.
‘‘Vajjīnaṃ veḷuvagāme, ahaṃ jīvitasaṅkhayā;Heṭṭhato veḷugumbasmiṃ, nibbāyissaṃ anāsavo’’ti. In Veḷugāma of the Vajjis, when my life span is exhausted, I, the taintless one, will attain Nibbāna beneath a bamboo thicket.

… Anuruddho thero…. … The Elder Anuruddha … 10. Pārāpariyattheragāthā 10.The Verses of the Elder Pārāpariya

920.
Samaṇassa ahu cintā, pupphitamhi mahāvane;Ekaggassa nisinnassa, pavivittassa jhāyino.

A thought occurred to the recluse as he sat meditating in seclusion in the great flowering forest, his mind unified.

921.
‘‘Aññathā lokanāthamhi, tiṭṭhante purisuttame;Iriyaṃ āsi bhikkhūnaṃ, aññathā dāni dissati.

The deportment of the bhikkhus was one way when the protector of the world, the supreme person, was living; but now it is seen to be another way.

922.
‘‘Sītavātaparittānaṃ, hirikopīnachādanaṃ;Mattaṭṭhiyaṃ abhuñjiṃsu, santuṭṭhā itarītare.

For protection from cold and wind and to cover their sense of shame, they ate in moderation, content with whatever they might receive.

923.
‘‘Paṇītaṃ yadi vā lūkhaṃ, appaṃ vā yadi vā bahuṃ;Yāpanatthaṃ abhuñjiṃsu, agiddhā nādhimucchitā.

Whether it was exquisite or rough, little or much, they ate for the sake of sustenance, not greedy, not infatuated.

924.
‘‘Jīvitānaṃ parikkhāre, bhesajje atha paccaye;Na bāḷhaṃ ussukā āsuṃ, yathā te āsavakkhaye.

Regarding life's requisites, medicines, and other supports, they were not as eager as they were for the destruction of the taints.

925.
‘‘Araññe rukkhamūlesu, kandarāsu guhāsu ca;Vivekamanubrūhantā, vihaṃsu tapparāyanā.

In the forest, at the foot of trees, in mountain clefts and caves, they dwelt developing seclusion, with that as their final goal.

926.
‘‘Nīcā niviṭṭhā subharā, mudū atthaddhamānasā;Abyāsekā amukharā, atthacintā vasānugā.

Humble, of settled ways, easy to support, gentle, with minds not obstinate; unentangled, not garrulous, intent on the goal, masters of themselves.

927.
‘‘Tato pāsādikaṃ āsi, gataṃ bhuttaṃ nisevitaṃ;Siniddhā teladhārāva, ahosi iriyāpatho.

Therefore their walking, eating, and their general conduct was inspiring; their deportment was like a smooth stream of oil.

928.
‘‘Sabbāsavaparikkhīṇā, mahājhāyī mahāhitā;Nibbutā dāni te therā, parittā dāni tādisā.

Those elders with all taints destroyed, great meditators of great benefit, are now quenched; few such ones exist now.

929.
‘‘Kusalānañca dhammānaṃ, paññāya ca parikkhayā;Sabbākāravarūpetaṃ, lujjate jinasāsanaṃ.

Through the destruction of wholesome qualities and of wisdom, the Victor’s teaching, endowed with all the best features, falls to ruin.

930.
‘‘Pāpakānañca dhammānaṃ, kilesānañca yo utu;Upaṭṭhitā vivekāya, ye ca saddhammasesakā.

This is the season for evil states and defilements, yet there are present those set on seclusion, the last remnants of the true Dhamma.

931.
‘‘Te kilesā pavaḍḍhantā, āvisanti bahuṃ janaṃ;Kīḷanti maññe bālehi, ummattehiva rakkhasā.

Those defilements, growing, enter into many people; I think they play with fools like demons with the mad.

932.
‘‘Kilesehābhibhūtā te, tena tena vidhāvitā;Narā kilesavatthūsu, sasaṅgāmeva ghosite.

Overcome by defilements, they run about here and there; people cry out amidst the bases for defilement, as if in a declared battle.

933.
‘‘Pariccajitvā saddhammaṃ, aññamaññehi bhaṇḍare;Diṭṭhigatāni anventā, idaṃ seyyoti maññare.

Having abandoned the true Dhamma, they quarrel with one another; following their own views, they think, “This is better!”

934.
‘‘Dhanañca puttaṃ bhariyañca, chaḍḍayitvāna niggatā;Kaṭacchubhikkhahetūpi, akicchāni nisevare.

Having gone forth, leaving behind wealth, sons, and wife, they engage in improper actions even for a spoonful of alms.

935.
‘‘Udarāvadehakaṃ bhutvā, sayantuttānaseyyakā;Kathaṃ vattenti [kathā vaḍḍhenti (sī. ka.)] paṭibuddhā, yā kathā satthugarahitā.

Having eaten their belly’s fill, they lie down, sleeping on their backs; when awakened, they engage in talk censured by the Teacher.

936.
‘‘Sabbakārukasippāni, cittiṃ katvāna [cittīkatvāna (sī.), cittaṃ katvāna (syā.)] sikkhare;Avūpasantā ajjhattaṃ, sāmaññatthoti acchati [tiriñcati (?)].

Having diligently learned all kinds of crafts and skills, but not being inwardly pacified, they think, 'This is the goal of recluseship!'

937.
‘‘Mattikaṃ telacuṇṇañca, udakāsanabhojanaṃ;Gihīnaṃ upanāmenti, ākaṅkhantā bahuttaraṃ.

They offer clay, oil, powder, water, seats, and food to householders, hoping for much more in return.

938.
‘‘Dantaponaṃ kapitthañca, pupphaṃ khādaniyāni ca;Piṇḍapāte ca sampanne, ambe āmalakāni ca.

Tooth-cleaners and wood-apples, flowers and edibles, and when alms-food is obtained, mangoes and myrobalans.

939.
‘‘Bhesajjesu yathā vejjā, kiccākicce yathā gihī;Gaṇikāva vibhūsāyaṃ, issare khattiyā yathā.

They are like doctors with their medicines, like householders with their duties; like a courtesan with her finery, like nobles who are rulers.

940.
‘‘Nekatikā vañcanikā, kūṭasakkhī apāṭukā;Bahūhi parikappehi, āmisaṃ paribhuñjare.

Deceitful, fraudulent, giving false evidence, crooked; with many schemes, they enjoy material things.

941.
‘‘Lesakappe pariyāye, parikappenudhāvitā;Jīvikatthā upāyena, saṅkaḍḍhanti bahuṃ dhanaṃ.

By means of pretexts and excuses, they run after their schemes; for the sake of a living, they scrape together much wealth by some device.

942.
‘‘Upaṭṭhāpenti parisaṃ, kammato no ca dhammato;Dhammaṃ paresaṃ desenti, lābhato no ca atthato.

They gather a following through their activities, not through the Dhamma; they teach the Dhamma to others for gain, not for the true goal.

943.
‘‘Saṅghalābhassa bhaṇḍanti, saṅghato paribāhirā;Paralābhopajīvantā, ahirīkā na lajjare. They quarrel over the Saṅgha's gains, though they are external to the Saṅgha; living on the gains of others, they are without conscience and feel no shame.


944.
‘‘Nānuyuttā tathā eke, muṇḍā saṅghāṭipārutā;Sambhāvanaṃyevicchanti, lābhasakkāramucchitā.

Though shaven-headed and clad in the outer robe, some are not truly devoted. Infatuated with gain and honor, they desire only to be esteemed.

945.
‘‘Evaṃ nānappayātamhi, na dāni sukaraṃ tathā;Aphusitaṃ vā phusituṃ, phusitaṃ vānurakkhituṃ.

When things have gone in these various ways, it is no longer easy to attain the unattained or to protect what has been attained.

946.
‘‘Yathā kaṇṭakaṭṭhānamhi, careyya anupāhano;Satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvāna, evaṃ gāme munī care.

Just as one without shoes would walk carefully on thorny ground, so, having established mindfulness, a sage should walk in the village.

947.
‘‘Saritvā pubbake yogī, tesaṃ vattamanussaraṃ;Kiñcāpi pacchimo kālo, phuseyya amataṃ padaṃ.

Remembering the ancient yogis and recollecting their conduct, even though this is the final age, one may yet touch the deathless state.

948.
‘‘Idaṃ vatvā sālavane, samaṇo bhāvitindriyo;Brāhmaṇo parinibbāyī, isi khīṇapunabbhavo’’ti. Having said this in the sāl-tree grove, the recluse with developed faculties, the brahmin, the seer whose renewed existence is destroyed, attained final Nibbāna. … Pārāpariyo [pārāsariyo (syā.)] thero…. … The Elder Pārāpariya … Vīsatinipāto niṭṭhito.

The Chapter of the Twenties is concluded. Tatruddānaṃ – The summary: Adhimutto pārāpariyo, telakāni raṭṭhapālo;Mālukyaselo bhaddiyo, aṅguli dibbacakkhuko. Adhimutta, Pārāpariya, Telakāni, and Raṭṭhapāla; Mālukyaputta, Sela, Bhaddiya, Aṅgulimāla, and the one with the Divine Eye. Pārāpariyo dasete, vīsamhi parikittitā;Gāthāyo dve satā honti, pañcatālīsa [244 gāthāyoyeva dissanti] uttarinti. These ten elders are proclaimed in the Chapter of Twenty. The verses number two hundred and forty-five.
