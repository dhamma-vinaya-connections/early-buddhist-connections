# SN 9.8 Kulagharaṇīsuttaṃ

## SN 9.8 The Discourse on the Housewife

228. Ekaṃ samayaṃ aññataro bhikkhu kosalesu viharati aññatarasmiṃ vanasaṇḍe. Tena kho pana samayena so bhikkhu aññatarasmiṃ kule ativelaṃ ajjhogāḷhappatto viharati. Atha kho yā tasmiṃ vanasaṇḍe adhivatthā devatā tassa bhikkhuno anukampikā atthakāmā taṃ bhikkhuṃ saṃvejetukāmā yā tasmiṃ kule kulagharaṇī, tassā vaṇṇaṃ abhinimminitvā yena so bhikkhu tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā taṃ bhikkhuṃ gāthāya ajjhabhāsi –

228.On one occasion, a certain bhikkhu was dwelling among the Kosalans in a certain forest grove. Now at that time, that bhikkhu was living having become excessively intimate with a certain family. Then a devatā who dwelt in that forest grove, compassionate and desiring his welfare, wishing to stir him up, manifested the form of the housewife of that family and approached the bhikkhu. Approaching, she addressed the bhikkhu with a verse:

‘‘Nadītīresu saṇṭhāne, sabhāsu rathiyāsu ca;Janā saṅgamma mantenti, mañca tañca [tvañca (ka.)] kimantara’’nti.

On riverbanks, at resting places, in assembly halls, and along the streets, people gather and converse, about this and that. What is the reason?

‘‘Bahūhi saddā paccūhā, khamitabbā tapassinā;Na tena maṅku hotabbaṃ, na hi tena kilissati.

Many sounds are hindrances; they should be endured by an ascetic. One should not be upset by them, for one is not defiled by them.

‘‘Yo ca saddaparittāsī, vane vātamigo yathā;Lahucittoti taṃ āhu, nāssa sampajjate vata’’nti.

He who is afraid of sound, like a deer in the forest, they say is light-minded; his vow does not succeed.
