# SN 7.12 Udayasuttaṃ

## SN 7.12 The Discourse to Udaya

198. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. Atha kho bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena udayassa brāhmaṇassa nivesanaṃ tenupasaṅkami. Atha kho udayo brāhmaṇo bhagavato pattaṃ odanena pūresi. Dutiyampi kho bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena udayassa brāhmaṇassa nivesanaṃ tenupasaṅkami…pe… tatiyampi kho udayo brāhmaṇo bhagavato pattaṃ odanena pūretvā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘pakaṭṭhakoyaṃ samaṇo gotamo punappunaṃ āgacchatī’’ti.

198.At Savatthi. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One, having dressed and taking his bowl and robe, went to the residence of the brahmin Udaya. Then the brahmin Udaya filled the Blessed One's bowl with rice. A second time, in the morning, the Blessed One, having dressed and taking his bowl and robe, went to the residence of the brahmin Udaya. A second time, the brahmin Udaya filled the Blessed One's bowl with rice. A third time, in the morning, the Blessed One, having dressed and taking his bowl and robe, went to the residence of the brahmin Udaya. A third time, the brahmin Udaya filled the Blessed One's bowl with rice and said this to the Blessed One: "This ascetic Gotama is greedy; he keeps coming again and again."

‘‘Punappunañceva vapanti bījaṃ, punappunaṃ vassati devarājā;Punappunaṃ khettaṃ kasanti kassakā, punappunaṃ dhaññamupeti raṭṭhaṃ.

"Again and again they sow the seed, again and again the king of gods rains; / Again and again the farmers plow the field, again and again the grain comes to the country."

‘‘Punappunaṃ yācakā yācayanti, punappunaṃ dānapatī dadanti;Punappunaṃ dānapatī daditvā, punappunaṃ saggamupenti ṭhānaṃ.

"Again and again beggars beg, again and again generous donors give; / Again and again generous donors give, again and again they ascend to a heavenly state."

‘‘Punappunaṃ khīranikā duhanti, punappunaṃ vaccho upeti mātaraṃ;Punappunaṃ kilamati phandati ca, punappunaṃ gabbhamupeti mando.

"Again and again milkers milk, again and again the calf approaches its mother; / Again and again one toils and trembles, again and again the fool goes to the womb."

‘‘Punappunaṃ jāyati mīyati ca, punappunaṃ sivathikaṃ [sīvathikaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] haranti;Maggañca laddhā apunabbhavāya, na punappunaṃ jāyati bhūripañño’’ti [punappunaṃ jāyati bhūripaññoti (syā. kaṃ. ka.)].

"Again and again one is born, and again and again one dies; again and again they carry one to the charnel ground. / Having found the path to non-rebirth, the one with vast wisdom is not born again and again."

Evaṃ vutte, udayo brāhmaṇo bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘abhikkantaṃ, bho gotama…pe… upāsakaṃ maṃ bhavaṃ gotamo dhāretu ajjatagge pāṇupetaṃ saraṇaṃ gata’’nti.

When this was said, the brahmin Udaya said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Just as if he were to set upright what had been overturned, or to reveal what had been hidden, or to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama made the Dhamma clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, and to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life from this day forward."
