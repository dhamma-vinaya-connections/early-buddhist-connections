# SN 7.8 Aggikasuttaṃ

## SN 7.8 The Fire Discourse

194. Ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā rājagahe viharati veḷuvane kalandakanivāpe. Tena kho pana samayena aggikabhāradvājassa brāhmaṇassa sappinā pāyaso sannihito hoti – ‘‘aggiṃ juhissāmi, aggihuttaṃ paricarissāmī’’ti.

194.On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. At that time the brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja had prepared a milk-rice with ghee, thinking: “I will make an offering to the fire, I will perform the fire sacrifice.”

Atha kho bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya rājagahaṃ piṇḍāya pāvisi. Rājagahe sapadānaṃ piṇḍāya caramāno yena aggikabhāradvājassa brāhmaṇassa nivesanaṃ tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā ekamantaṃ aṭṭhāsi. Addasā kho aggikabhāradvājo brāhmaṇo bhagavantaṃ piṇḍāya ṭhitaṃ. Disvāna bhagavantaṃ gāthāya ajjhabhāsi –

Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms. While wandering for alms in Rājagaha systematically, he approached the dwelling of the brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja; having approached, he stood to one side. The brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja saw the Blessed One standing for alms. Having seen him, he addressed the Blessed One with a verse:

‘‘Tīhi vijjāhi sampanno, jātimā sutavā bahū;Vijjācaraṇasampanno, somaṃ bhuñjeyya pāyasa’’nti.

“Endowed with the three knowledges, of noble birth, widely learned; perfect in knowledge and conduct, he should partake of this milk-rice.”

‘‘Bahumpi palapaṃ jappaṃ, na jaccā hoti brāhmaṇo;Antokasambu saṃkiliṭṭho, kuhanāparivārito.

“Though one may chant much empty talk, one is not a brahmin by birth. Inwardly rotten, defiled, surrounded by deceit.

‘‘Pubbenivāsaṃ yo vedī, saggāpāyañca passati;Atho jātikkhayaṃ patto, abhiññāvosito muni.

He who knows his past lives, and sees heaven and states of woe, and has attained the destruction of birth, the sage, perfected in higher knowledge.

‘‘Etāhi tīhi vijjāhi, tevijjo hoti brāhmaṇo;Vijjācaraṇasampanno, somaṃ bhuñjeyya pāyasa’’nti.

“By these three knowledges, a brahmin is threefold learned; endowed with knowledge and conduct, he should partake of this milk-rice.”

‘‘Bhuñjatu bhavaṃ gotamo. Brāhmaṇo bhava’’nti.

“Let Master Gotama eat. The Master is a brahmin.”

‘‘Gāthābhigītaṃ me abhojaneyyaṃ,Sampassataṃ brāhmaṇa nesa dhammo;Gāthābhigītaṃ panudanti buddhā,Dhamme sati brāhmaṇa vuttiresā.

“Food obtained by singing verses is not to be eaten by me. Brahmin, this is not the Dhamma for those who discern. The Buddhas reject food obtained by singing verses. This is the livelihood, brahmin, when the Dhamma exists.

‘‘Aññena ca kevalinaṃ mahesiṃ,Khīṇāsavaṃ kukkuccavūpasantaṃ;Annena pānena upaṭṭhahassu,Khettañhi taṃ puññapekkhassa hotī’’ti.

With other things, attend to the consummate one, the great sage, one whose taints are destroyed, whose remorse is stilled, with food and drink. For that is the field for one seeking merit.”

Evaṃ vutte, aggikabhāradvājo brāhmaṇo bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘abhikkantaṃ, bho gotama…pe… aññataro ca panāyasmā aggikabhāradvājo arahataṃ ahosī’’ti.

When this was said, the brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja said to the Blessed One: “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Just as if he were to set upright what was overturned, or to disclose what was hidden, or to point out the way to one who went astray, or to bring a lamp into the darkness so that those with eyesight could see forms—in the same way has Master Gotama expounded the Dhamma in various ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama accept me as a lay follower who has taken refuge from today onwards for as long as life lasts.” And Venerable Aggikabhāradvāja became one of the arahants.
