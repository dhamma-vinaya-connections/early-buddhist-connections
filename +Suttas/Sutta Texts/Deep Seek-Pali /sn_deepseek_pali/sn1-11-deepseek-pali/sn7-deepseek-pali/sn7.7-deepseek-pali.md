# SN 7.7 Suddhikasuttaṃ

## SN 7.7 The Purity Discourse

193. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. Atha kho suddhikabhāradvājo brāhmaṇo yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavatā saddhiṃ sammodi. Sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho suddhikabhāradvājo brāhmaṇo bhagavato santike imaṃ gāthaṃ ajjhabhāsi –

193.At Sāvatthī. Then the brahmin Suddhika Bhāradvāja approached the Blessed One; having approached, he exchanged polite greetings with the Blessed One. After exchanging courteous and amiable conversation, he sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the brahmin Suddhika Bhāradvāja addressed the Blessed One with this verse:

‘‘Na brāhmaṇo [nābrāhmaṇo (?)] sujjhati koci, loke sīlavāpi tapokaraṃ;Vijjācaraṇasampanno, so sujjhati na aññā itarā pajā’’ti.

“No brahmin in the world is purified, even if virtuous or practicing austerities. Only one accomplished in knowledge and conduct is purified, not other people.”

‘‘Bahumpi palapaṃ jappaṃ, na jaccā hoti brāhmaṇo;Antokasambu saṅkiliṭṭho, kuhanaṃ upanissito.

“Though one may chant much empty talk, one is not a brahmin by birth. Inwardly rotten, defiled, adhering to deceit.

‘‘Khattiyo brāhmaṇo vesso, suddo caṇḍālapukkuso;Āraddhavīriyo pahitatto, niccaṃ daḷhaparakkamo;Pappoti paramaṃ suddhiṃ, evaṃ jānāhi brāhmaṇā’’ti.

A noble, a brahmin, a merchant, a worker, an outcaste, or a sweeper—if one is energetic, resolute, always firmly striving, one attains supreme purity. Know this, O brahmin.”

Evaṃ vutte, suddhikabhāradvājo brāhmaṇo bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘abhikkantaṃ, bho gotama…pe… aññataro ca panāyasmā bhāradvājo arahataṃ ahosī’’ti.

When this was said, the brahmin Suddhika Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One: “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Just as if he were to set upright what was overturned, or to disclose what was hidden, or to point out the way to one who went astray, or to bring a lamp into the darkness so that those with eyesight could see forms—in the same way has Master Gotama expounded the Dhamma in various ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama accept me as a lay follower who has taken refuge from today onwards for as long as life lasts.” And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the arahants.
