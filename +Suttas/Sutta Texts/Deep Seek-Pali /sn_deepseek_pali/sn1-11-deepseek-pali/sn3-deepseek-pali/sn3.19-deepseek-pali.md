# SN 3.19 Paṭhamaaputtakasuttaṃ

## SN 3.19 The First Discourse on the Childless Man

130. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. Atha kho rājā pasenadi kosalo divā divassa yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho rājānaṃ pasenadiṃ kosalaṃ bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘handa, kuto nu tvaṃ, mahārāja, āgacchasi divā divassā’’ti?

130.At Savatthi. Then King Pasenadi Kosala, at midday, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, King Pasenadi Kosala was addressed by the Blessed One: “Well then, great king, where are you coming from at midday?”

‘‘Idha, bhante, sāvatthiyaṃ seṭṭhi gahapati kālaṅkato. Tamahaṃ aputtakaṃ sāpateyyaṃ rājantepuraṃ atiharitvā āgacchāmi. Asīti, bhante, satasahassāni hiraññasseva, ko pana vādo rūpiyassa! Tassa kho pana, bhante, seṭṭhissa gahapatissa evarūpo bhattabhogo ahosi – kaṇājakaṃ bhuñjati bilaṅgadutiyaṃ. Evarūpo vatthabhogo ahosi – sāṇaṃ dhāreti tipakkhavasanaṃ. Evarūpo yānabhogo ahosi – jajjararathakena yāti paṇṇachattakena dhāriyamānenā’’ti.

“Venerable sir, here in Savatthi a wealthy householder has died. I have come after confiscating the wealth of that childless man and bringing it to the royal palace. He had eighty hundred thousand [pieces] of gold alone, not to mention silver! Yet, venerable sir, that wealthy householder had such poor meals—he ate broken rice with sour gruel as the second dish. He wore such poor clothes—he wore a hempen garment patched in three places. He traveled in such a poor vehicle—he went in a dilapidated cart with a leaf parasol held over him.”

‘‘Evametaṃ, mahārāja, evametaṃ, mahārāja! Asappuriso kho, mahārāja, uḷāre bhoge labhitvā nevattānaṃ sukheti pīṇeti, na mātāpitaro sukheti pīṇeti, na puttadāraṃ sukheti pīṇeti, na dāsakammakaraporise sukheti pīṇeti, na mittāmacce sukheti pīṇeti, na samaṇabrāhmaṇesu uddhaggikaṃ dakkhiṇaṃ patiṭṭhāpeti sovaggikaṃ sukhavipākaṃ saggasaṃvattanikaṃ. Tassa te bhoge evaṃ sammā aparibhuñjiyamāne [aparibhuñjamāno (sabbattha)] rājāno vā haranti corā vā haranti aggi vā ḍahati udakaṃ vā vahati appiyā vā dāyādā haranti. Evaṃsa te [evaṃ sante (sī. pī.)], mahārāja, bhogā sammā aparibhuñjiyamānā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, no paribhogaṃ.

“So it is, great king, so it is, great king! An ignoble person, great king, having obtained abundant wealth, neither makes himself happy and pleased, nor makes his parents happy and pleased, nor his children and wife happy and pleased, nor his servants, workers, and employees happy and pleased, nor his friends and companions happy and pleased, nor does he establish an uplifting offering to ascetics and brahmins, one conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness, and leading to a heavenly realm. His wealth, being thus improperly used, is carried off by kings, or carried off by thieves, or fire burns it, or water carries it away, or unloved heirs carry it off. Thus, great king, his wealth, being improperly used, goes to ruin, not to enjoyment.

‘‘Seyyathāpi, mahārāja, amanussaṭṭhāne pokkharaṇī acchodakā sītodakā sātodakā setodakā supatitthā ramaṇīyā. Taṃ jano neva hareyya na piveyya na nahāyeyya na yathāpaccayaṃ vā kareyya. Evañhi taṃ, mahārāja, udakaṃ sammā aparibhuñjiyamānaṃ [aparibhuñjamānaṃ (syā. kaṃ.)] parikkhayaṃ gaccheyya, no paribhogaṃ. Evameva kho, mahārāja, asappuriso uḷāre bhoge labhitvā nevattānaṃ sukheti pīṇeti, na mātāpitaro sukheti pīṇeti, na puttadāraṃ sukheti pīṇeti, na dāsakammakaraporise sukheti pīṇeti, na mittāmacce sukheti pīṇeti, na samaṇabrāhmaṇesu uddhaggikaṃ dakkhiṇaṃ patiṭṭhāpeti sovaggikaṃ sukhavipākaṃ saggasaṃvattanikaṃ. Tassa te bhoge evaṃ sammā aparibhuñjiyamāne rājāno vā haranti corā vā haranti aggi vā ḍahati udakaṃ vā vahati appiyā vā dāyādā haranti. Evaṃsa te [evaṃ sante (sī. pī.)], mahārāja, bhogā sammā aparibhuñjiyamānā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, no paribhogaṃ.

Just as, great king, in a place uninhabited by humans, there might be a lotus pond with clear water, cool water, sweet water, white water, with good landing places and delightful. Yet people would neither carry away its water, nor drink it, nor bathe in it, nor make use of it according to their needs. Thus, great king, that water, not being properly utilized, would go to ruin, not to enjoyment. Even so, great king, when an ignoble person obtains abundant wealth, he neither makes himself happy and pleased, nor makes his parents happy and pleased, nor his children and wife happy and pleased, nor his servants, workers, and employees happy and pleased, nor his friends and companions happy and pleased, nor does he establish an uplifting offering to ascetics and brahmins, one conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness, and leading to a heavenly realm. His wealth, being thus improperly used, is carried off by kings, or carried off by thieves, or fire burns it, or water carries it away, or unloved heirs carry it off. Thus, great king, his wealth, being improperly used, goes to ruin, not to enjoyment.

‘‘Sappuriso ca kho, mahārāja, uḷāre bhoge labhitvā attānaṃ sukheti pīṇeti, mātāpitaro sukheti pīṇeti, puttadāraṃ sukheti pīṇeti, dāsakammakaraporise sukheti pīṇeti, mittāmacce sukheti pīṇeti, samaṇabrāhmaṇesu uddhaggikaṃ dakkhiṇaṃ patiṭṭhāpeti sovaggikaṃ sukhavipākaṃ saggasaṃvattanikaṃ. Tassa te bhoge evaṃ sammā paribhuñjiyamāne neva rājāno haranti, na corā haranti, na aggi ḍahati, na udakaṃ vahati, na appiyā dāyādā haranti. Evaṃsa te, mahārāja, bhogā sammā paribhuñjiyamānā paribhogaṃ gacchanti, no parikkhayaṃ.

A noble person, great king, having obtained abundant wealth, makes himself happy and pleased, makes his parents happy and pleased, makes his children and wife happy and pleased, makes his servants, workers, and employees happy and pleased, makes his friends and companions happy and pleased. He establishes an uplifting offering to ascetics and brahmins, one conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness, and leading to a heavenly realm. When his wealth is thus properly used, neither kings carry it off, nor thieves carry it off, nor fire burns it, nor water carries it away, nor unloved heirs carry it off. Thus, great king, his wealth, being properly used, goes to enjoyment, not to ruin.

‘‘Seyyathāpi, mahārāja, gāmassa vā nigamassa vā avidūre pokkharaṇī acchodakā sītodakā sātodakā setodakā supatitthā ramaṇīyā. Tañca udakaṃ jano hareyyapi piveyyapi nahāyeyyapi yathāpaccayampi kareyya. Evañhi taṃ, mahārāja, udakaṃ sammā paribhuñjiyamānaṃ paribhogaṃ gaccheyya, no parikkhayaṃ. Evameva kho, mahārāja, sappuriso uḷāre bhoge labhitvā attānaṃ sukheti pīṇeti, mātāpitaro sukheti pīṇeti, puttadāraṃ sukheti pīṇeti, dāsakammakaraporise sukheti pīṇeti, mittāmacce sukheti pīṇeti, samaṇabrāhmaṇesu uddhaggikaṃ dakkhiṇaṃ patiṭṭhāpeti sovaggikaṃ sukhavipākaṃ saggasaṃvattanikaṃ. Tassa te bhoge evaṃ sammā paribhuñjiyamāne neva rājāno haranti, na corā haranti, na aggi ḍahati, na udakaṃ vahati, na appiyā dāyādā haranti. Evaṃsa te, mahārāja, bhogā sammā paribhuñjiyamānā paribhogaṃ gacchanti, no parikkhaya’’nti.

Just as, great king, not far from a village or town there might be a lotus pond with clear water, cool water, sweet water, white water, with good landing places and delightful. And people might carry away that water, and drink it, bathe in it, or use it as needed. Thus, great king, that water, being properly used, would go to enjoyment, not to ruin. Even so, great king, when a noble person acquires abundant wealth, he makes himself happy and pleased, makes his parents happy and pleased, makes his children and wife happy and pleased, makes his servants, workers, and employees happy and pleased, makes his friends and companions happy and pleased. And he establishes an uplifting offering to ascetics and brahmins, one conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness, and leading to a heavenly realm. When his wealth is thus properly used, neither kings carry it off, nor thieves carry it off, nor fire burns it, nor water carries it away, nor unloved heirs carry it off. Thus, great king, his wealth, being properly used, goes to enjoyment, not to ruin.”

‘‘Amanussaṭṭhāne udakaṃva sītaṃ,Tadapeyyamānaṃ parisosameti;Evaṃ dhanaṃ kāpuriso labhitvā,Nevattanā bhuñjati no dadāti.

Like cool water in a place uninhabited by humans,When left undrunk, it dries up;So too, an ignoble person who gains wealth,Neither enjoys it himself nor gives it away.

Dhīro ca viññū adhigamma bhoge,So bhuñjati kiccakaro ca hoti;So ñātisaṅghaṃ nisabho bharitvā,Anindito saggamupeti ṭhāna’’nti.

The wise and discerning, having acquired wealth,Enjoys it and is active in good works;Supporting his circle of relatives without reserve,Blameless, he goes to a heavenly state.
