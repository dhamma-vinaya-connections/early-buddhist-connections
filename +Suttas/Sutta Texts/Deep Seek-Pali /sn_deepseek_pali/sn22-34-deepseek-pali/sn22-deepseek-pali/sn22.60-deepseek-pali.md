## SN 22.60 The Mahāli Sutta

60. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā vesāliyaṃ viharati mahāvane kūṭāgārasālāyaṃ. Atha kho mahāli licchavi yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami …pe… ekamantaṃ nisinno kho mahāli licchavi bhagavantaṃ etadavoca –

60.Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the Great Wood, in the Kūṭāgāra Hall. Then Mahāli the Licchavi approached the Blessed One... Having sat down to one side, Mahāli the Licchavi said to the Blessed One:

‘‘Pūraṇo, bhante, kassapo evamāha – ‘natthi hetu natthi paccayo sattānaṃ saṃkilesāya; ahetū appaccayā sattā saṃkilissanti. Natthi hetu natthi paccayo sattānaṃ visuddhiyā; ahetū appaccayā sattā visujjhantī’ti. Idha, bhagavā kimāhā’’ti?

"Venerable sir, Pūraṇa Kassapa says this: ‘There is no cause, no condition for the defilement of beings; beings are defiled without cause, without condition. There is no cause, no condition for the purification of beings; beings are purified without cause, without condition.’ What does the Blessed One say about this?"

‘‘Atthi, mahāli, hetu atthi paccayo sattānaṃ saṃkilesāya; sahetū sappaccayā sattā saṃkilissanti. Atthi, mahāli, hetu, atthi paccayo sattānaṃ visuddhiyā; sahetū sappaccayā sattā visujjhantī’’ti.

"There is, Mahāli, a cause, there is a condition for the defilement of beings; beings are defiled with a cause and a condition. There is, Mahāli, a cause, there is a condition for the purification of beings; beings are purified with a cause and a condition."

‘‘Katamo pana, bhante, hetu katamo paccayo sattānaṃ saṃkilesāya; kathaṃ sahetū sappaccayā sattā saṃkilissantī’’ti?

"But what, venerable sir, is the cause, what is the condition, for the defilement of beings? How do beings become defiled because of cause and condition?"

‘‘Rūpañca hidaṃ, mahāli, ekantadukkhaṃ abhavissa dukkhānupatitaṃ dukkhāvakkantaṃ anavakkantaṃ sukhena, nayidaṃ sattā rūpasmiṃ sārajjeyyuṃ. Yasmā ca kho, mahāli, rūpaṃ sukhaṃ sukhānupatitaṃ sukhāvakkantaṃ anavakkantaṃ dukkhena, tasmā sattā rūpasmiṃ sārajjanti; sārāgā saṃyujjanti; saṃyogā saṃkilissanti. Ayaṃ kho, mahāli, hetu, ayaṃ paccayo sattānaṃ saṃkilesāya; evaṃ sahetū sappaccayā sattā saṃkilissanti.

"If, Mahāli, form were wholly painful, followed by pain, immersed in pain, and not emerging with pleasure, beings would not be attracted to form. But because, Mahāli, form is pleasant, followed by pleasure, immersed in pleasure, and not emerging with pain, beings are attracted to form. Through attraction they are bound; through being bound they are defiled. This, Mahāli, is the cause and condition for the defilement of beings; thus, with cause and condition, beings are defiled.

‘‘Vedanā ca hidaṃ, mahāli, ekantadukkhā abhavissa dukkhānupatitā dukkhāvakkantā anavakkantā sukhena, nayidaṃ sattā vedanāya sārajjeyyuṃ. Yasmā ca kho, mahāli, vedanā sukhā sukhānupatitā sukhāvakkantā anavakkantā dukkhena, tasmā sattā vedanāya sārajjanti; sārāgā saṃyujjanti; saṃyogā saṃkilissanti. Ayampi kho, mahāli, hetu, ayaṃ paccayo sattānaṃ saṃkilesāya. Evampi sahetū sappaccayā sattā saṃkilissanti.

"If, Mahāli, feeling were wholly painful, followed by pain, immersed in pain, and not emerging with pleasure, beings would not be attracted to feeling. But because, Mahāli, feeling is pleasant, followed by pleasure, immersed in pleasure, and not emerging with pain, beings are attracted to feeling. Through attraction they are bound; through being bound they are defiled. This, too, Mahāli, is the cause and condition for the defilement of beings. Thus, too, with cause and condition, beings are defiled."

‘‘Saññā ca hidaṃ, mahāli…pe… saṅkhārā ca hidaṃ, mahāli, ekantadukkhā abhavissaṃsu dukkhānupatitā dukkhāvakkantā anavakkantā sukhena, nayidaṃ sattā saṅkhāresu sārajjeyyuṃ. Yasmā ca kho, mahāli, saṅkhārā sukhā sukhānupatitā sukhāvakkantā anavakkantā dukkhena, tasmā sattā saṅkhāresu sārajjanti; sārāgā saṃyujjanti; saṃyogā saṃkilissanti. Ayampi kho, mahāli, hetu, ayaṃ paccayo sattānaṃ saṃkilesāya. Evampi sahetū sappaccayā sattā saṃkilissanti.

"Perception, Mahāli...and volitional formations, Mahāli, if they were wholly painful, followed by pain, immersed in pain, and not emerging with pleasure, beings would not be attracted to volitional formations. But because, Mahāli, volitional formations are pleasant, followed by pleasure, immersed in pleasure, and not emerging with pain, beings are attracted to volitional formations. Through attraction they are bound; through being bound they are defiled. This, too, Mahāli, is the cause and condition for the defilement of beings. Thus, too, with cause and condition, beings are defiled."

‘‘Viññāṇañca hidaṃ, mahāli, ekantadukkhaṃ abhavissa dukkhānupatitaṃ dukkhāvakkantaṃ anavakkantaṃ sukhena, nayidaṃ sattā viññāṇasmiṃ sārajjeyyuṃ. Yasmā ca kho, mahāli, viññāṇaṃ sukhaṃ sukhānupatitaṃ sukhāvakkantaṃ anavakkantaṃ dukkhena, tasmā sattā viññāṇasmiṃ sārajjanti; sārāgā saṃyujjanti; saṃyogā saṃkilissanti. Ayampi kho, mahāli, hetu ayaṃ paccayo sattānaṃ saṃkilesāya. Evampi sahetū sappaccayā sattā saṃkilissantī’’ti.

"And consciousness, Mahāli, if it were wholly painful, followed by pain, immersed in pain, and not emerging with pleasure, beings would not be attracted to consciousness. But because, Mahāli, consciousness is pleasant, followed by pleasure, immersed in pleasure, and not emerging with pain, beings are attracted to consciousness. Through attraction they are bound; through being bound they are defiled. This, too, Mahāli, is the cause and condition for the defilement of beings. Thus, too, with cause and condition, beings are defiled."

‘‘Katamo pana, bhante, hetu katamo paccayo sattānaṃ visuddhiyā; kathaṃ sahetū sappaccayā sattā visujjhantī’’ti? ‘‘Rūpañca hidaṃ, mahāli, ekantasukhaṃ abhavissa sukhānupatitaṃ sukhāvakkantaṃ anavakkantaṃ dukkhena, nayidaṃ sattā rūpasmiṃ nibbindeyyuṃ. Yasmā ca kho, mahāli, rūpaṃ dukkhaṃ dukkhānupatitaṃ dukkhāvakkantaṃ anavakkantaṃ sukhena, tasmā sattā rūpasmiṃ nibbindanti; nibbindaṃ virajjanti; virāgā visujjhanti. Ayaṃ kho, mahāli, hetu, ayaṃ paccayo, sattānaṃ visuddhiyā. Evaṃ sahetū sappaccayā sattā visujjhanti’’.

"But what, venerable sir, is the cause, what is the condition for the purification of beings? How, with cause and condition, do beings become purified?" "If, Mahāli, form were wholly pleasant, followed by pleasure, immersed in pleasure, and not emerging with pain, beings would not become disenchanted with form. But because, Mahāli, form is painful, followed by pain, immersed in pain, and not emerging with pleasure, beings become disenchanted with form. Through disenchantment they become dispassionate; through dispassion they are purified. This, Mahāli, is the cause and condition for the purification of beings. Thus, with cause and condition, beings are purified."

‘‘Vedanā ca hidaṃ, mahāli, ekantasukhā abhavissa…pe… saññā ca hidaṃ, mahāli…pe… saṅkhārā ca hidaṃ, mahāli, ekantasukhā abhavissaṃsu…pe… viññāṇañca hidaṃ, mahāli, ekantasukhaṃ abhavissa sukhānupatitaṃ sukhāvakkantaṃ anavakkantaṃ dukkhena, nayidaṃ sattā viññāṇasmiṃ nibbindeyyuṃ. Yasmā ca kho, mahāli, viññāṇaṃ dukkhaṃ dukkhānupatitaṃ dukkhāvakkantaṃ anavakkantaṃ sukhena, tasmā sattā viññāṇasmiṃ nibbindanti; nibbindaṃ virajjanti; virāgā visujjhanti. Ayaṃ kho, mahāli, hetu, ayaṃ paccayo, sattānaṃ visuddhiyā. Evampi sahetū sappaccayā sattā visujjhantī’’ti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

"And if feeling, Mahāli, were wholly pleasant... perception, Mahāli... volitional formations, Mahāli, if they were wholly pleasant... consciousness, Mahāli, if it were wholly pleasant, followed by pleasure, immersed in pleasure, and not emerging with pain, beings would not become disenchanted with consciousness. But because, Mahāli, consciousness is painful, followed by pain, immersed in pain, and not emerging with pleasure, beings become disenchanted with consciousness. Through disenchantment they become dispassionate; through dispassion they are purified. This, too, Mahāli, is the cause and condition for the purification of beings. Thus, too, with cause and condition, beings are purified." The Eighth.
