52. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. ‘‘Rūpaṃ, bhikkhave, yoniso manasi karotha, rūpāniccatañca yathābhūtaṃ samanupassatha. Rūpaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu yoniso manasi karonto, rūpāniccatañca yathābhūtaṃ samanupassanto rūpasmiṃ nibbindati. Nandikkhayā rāgakkhayo, rāgakkhayā nandikkhayo. Nandirāgakkhayā cittaṃ vimuttaṃ suvimuttanti vuccati. Vedanaṃ, bhikkhave, yoniso manasi karotha, vedanāniccatañca yathābhūtaṃ samanupassatha. Vedanaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu yoniso manasi karonto, vedanāniccatañca yathābhūtaṃ samanupassanto vedanāya nibbindati. Nandikkhayā rāgakkhayo, rāgakkhayā nandikkhayo. Nandirāgakkhayā cittaṃ vimuttaṃ suvimuttanti vuccati. Saññaṃ bhikkhave… saṅkhāre, bhikkhave, yoniso manasi karotha, saṅkhārāniccatañca yathābhūtaṃ samanupassatha. Saṅkhāre, bhikkhave, bhikkhu yoniso manasi karonto, saṅkhārāniccataṃ yathābhūtaṃ samanupassanto saṅkhāresu nibbindati. Nandikkhayā rāgakkhayo, rāgakkhayā nandikkhayo. Nandirāgakkhayā cittaṃ vimuttaṃ suvimuttanti vuccati. Viññāṇaṃ, bhikkhave, yoniso manasi karotha, viññāṇāniccatañca yathābhūtaṃ samanupassatha. Viññāṇaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu yoniso manasi karonto, viññāṇāniccatañca yathābhūtaṃ samanupassanto viññāṇasmiṃ nibbindati. Nandikkhayā rāgakkhayo, rāgakkhayā nandikkhayo. Nandirāgakkhayā cittaṃ vimuttaṃ suvimuttanti vuccatī’’ti. Dasamaṃ.

52.At Sāvatthī. “Monks, attend carefully to form, and truly see the impermanence of form. A monk who attends carefully to form and truly sees the impermanence of form becomes disenchanted with form. With the fading of delight comes the fading of lust; with the fading of lust comes the fading of delight. Through the fading of delight and lust, the mind is liberated and is called well-liberated. Monks, attend carefully to feeling, and truly see the impermanence of feeling. A monk who attends carefully to feeling and truly sees the impermanence of feeling becomes disenchanted with feeling. With the fading of delight comes the fading of lust; with the fading of lust comes the fading of delight. Through the fading of delight and lust, the mind is liberated and is called well-liberated. Monks, attend carefully to perception… Monks, attend carefully to volitional formations, and truly see the impermanence of volitional formations. A monk who attends carefully to volitional formations and truly sees the impermanence of volitional formations becomes disenchanted with volitional formations. With the fading of delight comes the fading of lust; with the fading of lust comes the fading of delight. Through the fading of delight and lust, the mind is liberated and is called well-liberated. Monks, attend carefully to consciousness, and truly see the impermanence of consciousness. A monk who attends carefully to consciousness and truly sees the impermanence of consciousness becomes disenchanted with consciousness. With the fading of delight comes the fading of lust; with the fading of lust comes the fading of delight. Through the fading of delight and lust, the mind is liberated and is called well-liberated.” The tenth.

Attadīpavaggo pañcamo.

The Fifth Chapter: Oneself as a Lamp.

Tassuddānaṃ –

The Summary:

Attadīpā paṭipadā, dve ca honti aniccatā;Samanupassanā khandhā, dve soṇā dve nandikkhayena cāti.

Oneself as a lamp, the way of practice; and there are two impermanences; contemplation of aggregates; two Soṇas; and two by way of the fading of delight.

Mūlapaṇṇāsako samatto.

The Root Fifty is concluded.

Tassa mūlapaṇṇāsakassa vagguddānaṃ –

The Summary of the Chapters in the Root Fifty:

Nakulapitā anicco ca, bhāro natumhākena ca;Attadīpena paññāso, paṭhamo tena pavuccatīti.

Nakulapitā, and Impermanence; Burden, and Not Yours; by Oneself as a Lamp, the fifty is therefore called the first.
