## SN 22.36 The Second Discourse on a Certain Bhikkhu

36. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. Atha kho aññataro bhikkhu yena bhagavā…pe… ekamantaṃ nisinno kho so bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sādhu me, bhante, bhagavā saṃkhittena dhammaṃ desetu yamahaṃ bhagavato dhammaṃ sutvā eko vūpakaṭṭho appamatto ātāpī pahitatto vihareyya’’nti. ‘‘Yaṃ kho, bhikkhu, anuseti taṃ anumīyati; yaṃ anumīyati tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Yaṃ nānuseti na taṃ anumīyati; yaṃ nānumīyati na tena saṅkhaṃ gacchatī’’ti. ‘‘Aññātaṃ, bhagavā; aññātaṃ, sugatā’’ti.

36.At Savatthi. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One… and sat down to one side. Seated there, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute.” “Whatever, bhikkhu, lies latent, that is inferred; by what is inferred, by that one is reckoned. Whatever does not lie latent, that is not inferred; by what is not inferred, by that one is not reckoned.” “I have understood, Blessed One; I have understood, Fortunate One.”

‘‘Yathā kathaṃ pana tvaṃ, bhikkhu, mayā saṃkhittena bhāsitassa vitthārena atthaṃ ājānāsī’’ti? ‘‘Rūpaṃ ce, bhante, anuseti taṃ anumīyati; yaṃ anumīyati tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Vedanaṃ ce anuseti… saññaṃ ce anuseti… saṅkhāre ce anuseti… viññāṇaṃ ce anuseti taṃ anumīyati; yaṃ anumīyati tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Rūpaṃ ce, bhante, nānuseti na taṃ anumīyati; yaṃ nānumīyati na tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Vedanaṃ ce nānuseti… saññaṃ ce nānuseti… saṅkhāre ce nānuseti… viññāṇaṃ ce nānuseti na taṃ anumīyati; yaṃ nānumīyati na tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Imassa khvāhaṃ, bhante, bhagavatā saṃkhittena bhāsitassa evaṃ vitthārena atthaṃ ājānāmī’’ti.

“But how, bhikkhu, do you understand in detail the meaning of what I have spoken briefly?” “If, venerable sir, form lies latent, that is inferred; by what is inferred, by that one is reckoned. If feeling lies latent… perception lies latent… volitional formations lie latent… consciousness lies latent, that is inferred; by what is inferred, by that one is reckoned. If, venerable sir, form does not lie latent, that is not inferred; by what is not inferred, by that one is not reckoned. If feeling does not lie latent… perception does not lie latent… volitional formations do not lie latent… consciousness does not lie latent, that is not inferred; by what is not inferred, by that one is not reckoned. Thus, venerable sir, I understand in detail the meaning of what the Blessed One has spoken briefly.”

‘‘Sādhu sādhu, bhikkhu! Sādhu kho tvaṃ, bhikkhu, mayā saṃkhittena bhāsitassa vitthārena atthaṃ ājānāsi. Rūpaṃ ce, bhikkhu, anuseti taṃ anumīyati; yaṃ anumīyati tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Vedanaṃ ce, bhikkhu… saññaṃ ce, bhikkhu… saṅkhāre ce, bhikkhu… viññāṇaṃ ce, bhikkhu, anuseti taṃ anumīyati; yaṃ anumīyati tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Rūpaṃ ce, bhikkhu, nānuseti na taṃ anumīyati; yaṃ nānumīyati na tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Vedanaṃ ce nānuseti… saññaṃ ce nānuseti… saṅkhāre ce nānuseti… viññāṇaṃ ce nānuseti na taṃ anumīyati; yaṃ nānumīyati na tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Imassa kho, bhikkhu, mayā saṃkhittena bhāsitassa evaṃ vitthārena attho daṭṭhabbo’’ti…pe… aññataro ca pana so bhikkhu arahataṃ ahosīti. Catutthaṃ.

“Good, good, bhikkhu! It is good, bhikkhu, that you understand in detail the meaning of what I have stated briefly. If, bhikkhu, form lies latent, that is inferred; by what is inferred, by that one is reckoned. If feeling, bhikkhu… perception, bhikkhu… volitional formations, bhikkhu… consciousness, bhikkhu, lies latent, that is inferred; by what is inferred, by that one is reckoned. If, bhikkhu, form does not lie latent, that is not inferred; by what is not inferred, by that one is not reckoned. If feeling does not lie latent… perception does not lie latent… volitional formations do not lie latent… consciousness does not lie latent, that is not inferred; by what is not inferred, by that one is not reckoned. This, bhikkhu, is how the meaning of what I have stated briefly should be seen in detail.” …And that bhikkhu became one of the arahants. The fourth.
