# SN 22.128 Tatiyasamudayadhammasuttaṃ

## SN 22.128 The Third Discourse on the Nature of Arising

128. Ekaṃ samayaṃ āyasmā ca sāriputto āyasmā ca mahākoṭṭhiko bārāṇasiyaṃ viharanti isipatane migadāye…pe… ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā mahākoṭṭhiko āyasmantaṃ sāriputtaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘‘vijjā, vijjā’ti, āvuso sāriputta, vuccati. Katamā nu kho, āvuso, vijjā, kittāvatā ca vijjāgato hotī’’ti?

128.At one time the Venerable Sāriputta and the Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita were staying at Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana. … Sitting to one side, the Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita said to the Venerable Sāriputta: "‘Knowledge, knowledge,’ friend Sāriputta, is said. What, friend, is knowledge, and to what extent has one arrived at knowledge?"

‘‘Idhāvuso, sutavā ariyasāvako samudayadhammaṃ rūpaṃ ‘samudayadhammaṃ rūpa’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti; vayadhammaṃ rūpaṃ…pe… samudayavayadhammaṃ rūpaṃ ‘samudayavayadhammaṃ rūpa’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti; samudayadhammaṃ vedanaṃ…pe… samudayavayadhammā vedanā … samudayadhammaṃ saññaṃ…pe… samudayadhamme saṅkhāre… vayadhamme saṅkhāre… samudayavayadhamme saṅkhāre ‘samudayavayadhammā saṅkhārā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Samudayadhammaṃ viññāṇaṃ… vayadhammaṃ viññāṇaṃ… samudayavayadhammaṃ viññāṇaṃ ‘samudayavayadhammaṃ viññāṇa’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Ayaṃ vuccatāvuso, vijjā; ettāvatā ca vijjāgato hotī’’ti. Tatiyaṃ.

Here, friend, a learned noble disciple understands form as subject to arising: ‘Form is subject to arising,’ as it actually is. He understands form as subject to ceasing: ‘Form is subject to ceasing,’ as it actually is. He understands form as subject to arising and ceasing: ‘Form is subject to arising and ceasing,’ as it actually is. He understands feeling as subject to arising: ‘Feeling is subject to arising,’ as it actually is. He understands feeling as subject to ceasing: ‘Feeling is subject to ceasing,’ as it actually is. He understands feeling as subject to arising and ceasing: ‘Feeling is subject to arising and ceasing,’ as it actually is. He understands perception as subject to arising: ‘Perception is subject to arising,’ as it actually is. He understands perception as subject to ceasing: ‘Perception is subject to ceasing,’ as it actually is. He understands perception as subject to arising and ceasing: ‘Perception is subject to arising and ceasing,’ as it actually is. He understands volitional formations as subject to arising: ‘Volitional formations are subject to arising,’ as it actually is. He understands volitional formations as subject to ceasing: ‘Volitional formations are subject to ceasing,’ as it actually is. He understands volitional formations as subject to arising and ceasing: ‘Volitional formations are subject to arising and ceasing,’ as it actually is. He understands consciousness as subject to arising: ‘Consciousness is subject to arising,’ as it actually is. He understands consciousness as subject to ceasing: ‘Consciousness is subject to ceasing,’ as it actually is. He understands consciousness as subject to arising and ceasing: ‘Consciousness is subject to arising and ceasing,’ as it actually is. This, friend, is called knowledge; and to this extent one has arrived at knowledge." Third.
