# SN 22.35 Aññatarabhikkhusuttaṃ

## SN 22.35 A Certain Monk

35. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. Atha kho aññataro bhikkhu yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho so bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sādhu me, bhante, bhagavā saṃkhittena dhammaṃ desetu; yamahaṃ bhagavato dhammaṃ sutvā eko vūpakaṭṭho, appamatto ātāpī pahitatto vihareyya’’nti. ‘‘Yaṃ kho, bhikkhu, anuseti, tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati; yaṃ nānuseti, na tena saṅkhaṃ gacchatī’’ti. ‘‘Aññātaṃ, bhagavā; aññātaṃ, sugatā’’ti.

35.At Sāvatthī. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. As he sat there, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, secluded, diligent, ardent, and resolute.” “Monk, what one clings to, by that one is designated; what one does not cling to, by that one is not designated.” “Understood, Blessed One; understood, Fortunate One.”

‘‘Yathā kathaṃ pana tvaṃ, bhikkhu, mayā saṃkhittena bhāsitassa vitthārena atthaṃ ājānāsī’’ti? ‘‘Rūpaṃ ce, bhante, anuseti tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Vedanaṃ ce anuseti tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Saññaṃ ce anuseti tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Saṅkhāre ce anuseti tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Viññāṇaṃ ce anuseti tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Rūpaṃ ce, bhante, nānuseti na tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Vedanaṃ ce… saññaṃ ce… saṅkhāre ce… viññāṇaṃ ce nānuseti na tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Imassa khvāhaṃ, bhante, bhagavatā saṃkhittena bhāsitassa evaṃ vitthārena atthaṃ ājānāmī’’ti.

“But how, bhikkhu, do you understand in detail the meaning of what I have stated in brief?” “Venerable sir, if one clings to form, by that one is designated. If one clings to feeling, by that one is designated. If one clings to perception, by that one is designated. If one clings to volitional formations, by that one is designated. If one clings to consciousness, by that one is designated. If, venerable sir, one does not cling to form, by that one is not designated. If one does not cling to feeling… perception… volitional formations… consciousness, by that one is not designated. It is in this way, venerable sir, that I understand in detail the meaning of what the Blessed One has stated in brief.”

‘‘Sādhu sādhu, bhikkhu! Sādhu kho tvaṃ, bhikkhu, mayā saṃkhittena bhāsitassa vitthārena atthaṃ ājānāsi. Rūpaṃ ce, bhikkhu, anuseti tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Vedanaṃ ce… saññaṃ ce… saṅkhāre ce… viññāṇaṃ ce anuseti tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Rūpaṃ ce, bhikkhu, nānuseti na tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Vedanaṃ ce… saññaṃ ce… saṅkhāre ce… viññāṇaṃ ce nānuseti na tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Imassa kho, bhikkhu, mayā saṃkhittena, bhāsitassa evaṃ vitthārena attho daṭṭhabbo’’ti.

“Good, good, bhikkhu! It is good that you understand in detail the meaning of what I have stated in brief. If, bhikkhu, one clings to form, by that one is designated. If one clings to feeling… perception… volitional formations… consciousness, by that one is designated. If, bhikkhu, one does not cling to form, by that one is not designated. If one does not cling to feeling… perception… volitional formations… consciousness, by that one is not designated. It is in this way, bhikkhu, that the meaning of what I have stated in brief should be understood in detail.”

Atha kho so bhikkhu bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinanditvā anumoditvā uṭṭhāyāsanā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṃ katvā pakkāmi.

Then that bhikkhu, delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed One’s words, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed.

Atha kho so bhikkhu eko vūpakaṭṭho appamatto ātāpī pahitatto viharanto nacirasseva – yassatthāya kulaputtā sammadeva agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajanti tadanuttaraṃ – brahmacariyapariyosānaṃ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja vihāsi. ‘‘Khīṇā jāti, vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ, kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ, nāparaṃ itthattāyā’’ti abbhaññāsi. Aññataro ca pana so bhikkhu arahataṃ ahosīti. Tatiyaṃ.

Then that bhikkhu, dwelling alone, secluded, diligent, ardent, and resolute, before long, with his own direct knowledge, he realized in this very life and dwelt in that unsurpassed culmination of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness. He understood: “Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.” And that bhikkhu became one of the arahants.
