51. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. ‘‘Aniccaññeva, bhikkhave, bhikkhu rūpaṃ aniccanti passati. Sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi. Sammā passaṃ nibbindati. Nandikkhayā rāgakkhayo, rāgakkhayā nandikkhayo. Nandirāgakkhayā cittaṃ vimuttaṃ suvimuttanti vuccati. Aniccaññeva, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vedanaṃ aniccanti passati. Sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi. Sammā passaṃ nibbindati. Nandikkhayā rāgakkhayo, rāgakkhayā nandikkhayo. Nandirāgakkhayā cittaṃ vimuttaṃ suvimuttanti vuccati. Anicceyeva, bhikkhave, bhikkhu saññaṃ aniccanti passati…pe… anicceyeva bhikkhave, bhikkhu saṅkhāre aniccāti passati. Sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi. Sammā passaṃ nibbindati. Nandikkhayā rāgakkhayo, rāgakkhayā nandikkhayo. Nandirāgakkhayā cittaṃ vimuttaṃ suvimuttanti vuccati. Aniccaññeva, bhikkhave, bhikkhu viññāṇaṃ aniccanti passati. Sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi. Sammā passaṃ nibbindati. Nandikkhayā rāgakkhayo, rāgakkhayā nandikkhayo. Nandirāgakkhayā cittaṃ vimuttaṃ suvimuttanti vuccatī’’ti. Navamaṃ.

51.At Sāvatthī. “Monks, a monk sees form as impermanent. That is his right view. Seeing rightly, he becomes disenchanted. With the fading of delight comes the fading of lust; with the fading of lust comes the fading of delight. Through the fading of delight and lust, the mind is liberated and is called well-liberated. Monks, a monk sees feeling as impermanent. That is his right view. Seeing rightly, he becomes disenchanted. With the fading of delight comes the fading of lust; with the fading of lust comes the fading of delight. Through the fading of delight and lust, the mind is liberated and is called well-liberated. Monks, a monk sees perception as impermanent… Monks, a monk sees volitional formations as impermanent. That is his right view. Seeing rightly, he becomes disenchanted. With the fading of delight comes the fading of lust; with the fading of lust comes the fading of delight. Through the fading of delight and lust, the mind is liberated and is called well-liberated. Monks, a monk sees consciousness as impermanent. That is his right view. Seeing rightly, he becomes disenchanted. With the fading of delight comes the fading of lust; with the fading of lust comes the fading of delight. Through the fading of delight and lust, the mind is liberated and is called well-liberated.” The ninth.
