## SN 22.104 The Discourse on Suffering

104. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. ‘‘Dukkhañca vo, bhikkhave, desessāmi dukkhasamudayañca dukkhanirodhañca dukkhanirodhagāminiñca paṭipadaṃ. Taṃ suṇātha. Katamañca, bhikkhave, dukkhaṃ? Pañcupādānakkhandhātissa vacanīyaṃ. Katame pañca? Seyyathidaṃ – rūpupādānakkhandho…pe… viññāṇupādānakkhandho. Idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, dukkhaṃ. Katamo ca, bhikkhave, dukkhasamudayo? Yāyaṃ taṇhā ponobhavikā…pe… kāmataṇhā, bhavataṇhā, vibhavataṇhā – ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, dukkhasamudayo. Katamo ca, bhikkhave, dukkhanirodho? Yo tassāyeva taṇhāya asesavirāganirodho cāgo paṭinissaggo mutti anālayo – ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, dukkhanirodho. Katamā ca, bhikkhave, dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā? Ayameva ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo. Seyyathidaṃ – sammādiṭṭhi…pe… sammāsamādhi. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’’ti. Dutiyaṃ.

104.At Sāvatthī. “I will teach you, bhikkhus, suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the way leading to the cessation of suffering. Listen to that. And what, bhikkhus, is suffering? It should be said: the five aggregates of clinging. Which five? That is, the form aggregate of clinging…the consciousness aggregate of clinging. This, bhikkhus, is called suffering. And what, bhikkhus, is the origin of suffering? It is this craving that leads to renewed existence…namely, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, craving for non-existence. This, bhikkhus, is called the origin of suffering. And what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of suffering? It is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that very craving, its abandonment, relinquishment, liberation, and non-attachment. This, bhikkhus, is called the cessation of suffering. And what, bhikkhus, is the way leading to the cessation of suffering? It is just this Noble Eightfold Path. That is, right view…right concentration. This, bhikkhus, is called the way leading to the cessation of suffering.” Second.
