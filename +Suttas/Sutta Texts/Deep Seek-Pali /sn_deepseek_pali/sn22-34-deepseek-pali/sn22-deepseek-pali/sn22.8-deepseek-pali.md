## SN 22.8 The Second Discourse on Clinging and Worry

8. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. ‘‘Upādāparitassanañca vo, bhikkhave, desessāmi anupādāaparitassanañca. Taṃ suṇātha…pe… kathañca, bhikkhave, upādāparitassanā hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, assutavā puthujjano rūpaṃ ‘etaṃ mama, esohamasmi, eso me attā’ti samanupassati. Tassa taṃ rūpaṃ vipariṇamati aññathā hoti. Tassa rūpavipariṇāmaññathābhāvā uppajjanti sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā. Vedanaṃ etaṃ mama…pe… saññaṃ etaṃ mama… saṅkhāre etaṃ mama… viññāṇaṃ ‘etaṃ mama, esohamasmi, eso me attā’ti samanupassati. Tassa taṃ viññāṇaṃ vipariṇamati aññathā hoti. Tassa viññāṇavipariṇāmaññathābhāvā uppajjanti sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, upādāparitassanā hoti.

8.At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you about worry through clinging and non-worry through non-clinging. Listen to that and attend carefully. I will speak. And how, bhikkhus, does worry through clinging occur? Here, bhikkhus, an uninstructed ordinary person regards form thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ That form of his alters and becomes otherwise. From the alteration and change of that form, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise. He regards feeling thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ That feeling of his alters and becomes otherwise. From the alteration and change of that feeling, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise. He regards perception thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ That perception of his alters and becomes otherwise. From the alteration and change of that perception, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise. He regards mental formations thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ Those mental formations of his alter and become otherwise. From the alteration and change of those mental formations, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise. He regards consciousness thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ That consciousness of his alters and becomes otherwise. From the alteration and change of that consciousness, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that worry through clinging occurs.”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, anupādāaparitassanā hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, sutavā ariyasāvako rūpaṃ ‘netaṃ mama, nesohamasmi, na meso attā’ti samanupassati. Tassa taṃ rūpaṃ vipariṇamati aññathā hoti. Tassa rūpavipariṇāmaññathābhāvā nuppajjanti sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā. Vedanaṃ netaṃ mama… saññaṃ netaṃ mama… saṅkhāre netaṃ mama… viññāṇaṃ ‘netaṃ mama, nesohamasmi, na meso attā’ti samanupassati. Tassa taṃ viññāṇaṃ vipariṇamati aññathā hoti. Tassa viññāṇavipariṇāmaññathābhāvā nuppajjanti sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, anupādāaparitassanā hotī’’ti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

“And how, bhikkhus, does non-worry through non-clinging occur? Here, bhikkhus, an instructed noble disciple regards form thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ That form of his alters and becomes otherwise. From the alteration and change of that form, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair do not arise. He regards feeling thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ That feeling of his alters and becomes otherwise. From the alteration and change of that feeling, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair do not arise. He regards perception thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ That perception of his alters and becomes otherwise. From the alteration and change of that perception, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair do not arise. He regards mental formations thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Those mental formations of his alter and become otherwise. From the alteration and change of those mental formations, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair do not arise. He regards consciousness thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ That consciousness of his alters and becomes otherwise. From the alteration and change of that consciousness, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair do not arise. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that non-worry through non-clinging occurs.” The eighth.
