# SN 22.127 Dutiyasamudayadhammasuttaṃ

## SN 22.127 The Second Discourse on the Nature of Arising

127. Ekaṃ samayaṃ āyasmā ca sāriputto āyasmā ca mahākoṭṭhiko bārāṇasiyaṃ viharanti isipatane migadāye. Atha kho āyasmā mahākoṭṭhiko sāyanhasamayaṃ paṭisallānā vuṭṭhito…pe… ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā mahākoṭṭhiko āyasmantaṃ sāriputtaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘‘avijjā, avijjā’ti, āvuso sāriputta, vuccati. Katamā nu kho, āvuso, avijjā, kittāvatā ca avijjāgato hotī’’ti?

127.At one time the Venerable Sāriputta and the Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita were staying at Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana. Then, in the evening, the Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita arose from seclusion... Sitting to one side, the Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita said to the Venerable Sāriputta: "‘Ignorance, ignorance,’ friend Sāriputta, is said. Now what, friend, is ignorance, and to what extent does one fall into ignorance?"

‘‘Idhāvuso assutavā puthujjano samudayadhammaṃ rūpaṃ ‘samudayadhammaṃ rūpa’nti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti; vayadhammaṃ rūpaṃ…pe… ‘samudayavayadhammaṃ rūpa’nti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Samudayadhammaṃ vedanaṃ…pe… vayadhammaṃ vedanaṃ…pe… ‘samudayavayadhammā vedanā’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Samudayadhammaṃ saññaṃ…pe… samudayadhamme saṅkhāre…pe… vayadhamme saṅkhāre…pe… samudayavayadhamme saṅkhāre ‘samudayavayadhammā saṅkhārā’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Samudayadhammaṃ viññāṇaṃ…pe… samudayavayadhammaṃ viññāṇaṃ ‘samudayavayadhammaṃ viññāṇa’nti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Ayaṃ vuccati, āvuso, avijjā; ettāvatā ca avijjāgato hotī’’ti. Dutiyaṃ.

Here, friend, an uninstructed ordinary person does not understand form as subject to arising: 'Form is subject to arising'—as it actually is. He does not understand form as subject to passing away: 'Form is subject to passing away'—as it actually is. He does not understand form as subject to both arising and passing away: 'Form is subject to both arising and passing away'—as it actually is. He does not understand feeling as subject to arising: 'Feeling is subject to arising'—as it actually is. He does not understand feeling as subject to passing away: 'Feeling is subject to passing away'—as it actually is. He does not understand feeling as subject to both arising and passing away: 'Feeling is subject to both arising and passing away'—as it actually is. He does not understand perception as subject to arising: 'Perception is subject to arising'—as it actually is. He does not understand perception as subject to passing away: 'Perception is subject to passing away'—as it actually is. He does not understand perception as subject to both arising and passing away: 'Perception is subject to both arising and passing away'—as it actually is. He does not understand volitional formations as subject to arising: 'Volitional formations are subject to arising'—as it actually is. He does not understand volitional formations as subject to passing away: 'Volitional formations are subject to passing away'—as it actually is. He does not understand volitional formations as subject to both arising and passing away: 'Volitional formations are subject to both arising and passing away'—as it actually is. He does not understand consciousness as subject to arising: 'Consciousness is subject to arising'—as it actually is. He does not understand consciousness as subject to passing away: 'Consciousness is subject to passing away'—as it actually is. He does not understand consciousness as subject to both arising and passing away: 'Consciousness is subject to both arising and passing away'—as it actually is. This is called, friend, ignorance; and to this extent one is immersed in ignorance." The second.
