## SN 22.38 The Second Ananda Sutta.

38. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ bhagavā etadavoca –

38.At Sāvatthī. There, the Blessed One said this to the Venerable Ānanda, who was sitting to one side:

‘‘Sace taṃ, ānanda, evaṃ puccheyyuṃ – ‘katamesaṃ, āvuso ānanda, dhammānaṃ uppādo paññāyittha, vayo paññāyittha, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyittha? Katamesaṃ dhammānaṃ uppādo paññāyissati, vayo paññāyissati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyissati? Katamesaṃ dhammānaṃ uppādo paññāyati, vayo paññāyati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyatī’ti? Evaṃ puṭṭho tvaṃ, ānanda, kinti byākareyyāsī’’ti? ‘‘Sace maṃ, bhante, evaṃ puccheyyuṃ – ‘katamesaṃ, āvuso ānanda, dhammānaṃ uppādo paññāyittha, vayo paññāyittha, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyittha? Katamesaṃ dhammānaṃ uppādo paññāyissati, vayo paññāyissati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyissati? Katamesaṃ dhammānaṃ uppādo paññāyati, vayo paññāyati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyatī’ti? Evaṃ puṭṭhohaṃ, bhante, evaṃ byākareyyaṃ – ‘yaṃ kho, āvuso, rūpaṃ atītaṃ niruddhaṃ vipariṇataṃ; tassa uppādo paññāyittha, vayo paññāyittha, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyittha. Yā vedanā atītā niruddhā vipariṇatā; tassā uppādo paññāyittha, vayo paññāyittha, ṭhitāya aññathattaṃ paññāyittha. Yā saññā… ye saṅkhārā atītā niruddhā vipariṇatā; tesaṃ uppādo paññāyittha, vayo paññāyittha, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyittha. Yaṃ viññāṇaṃ atītaṃ niruddhaṃ vipariṇataṃ; tassa uppādo paññāyittha, vayo paññāyittha, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyittha. Imesaṃ kho, āvuso, dhammānaṃ uppādo paññāyittha, vayo paññāyittha, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyittha’’’.

"If they were to ask you, Ānanda: ‘Friend Ānanda, of what phenomena was the arising discerned, the passing away discerned, and the alteration of its persistence discerned? Of what phenomena will the arising be discerned, the passing away be discerned, and the alteration of its persistence be discerned? Of what phenomena is the arising discerned, the passing away discerned, and the alteration of its persistence discerned?’ Being asked thus, Ānanda, how would you answer?" "If, venerable sir, they were to ask me: ‘Friend Ānanda, of what phenomena was the arising discerned, the passing away discerned, and the alteration of its persistence discerned? Of what phenomena will the arising be discerned, the passing away be discerned, and the alteration of its persistence be discerned? Of what phenomena is the arising discerned, the passing away discerned, and the alteration of its persistence discerned?’ Being asked thus, venerable sir, I would answer thus: ‘Friends, whatever form was past, ceased, and changed: its arising was discerned, its passing away was discerned, and the alteration of its persistence was discerned. Whatever feeling was past, ceased, and changed: its arising was discerned, its passing away was discerned, and the alteration of its persistence was discerned. Whatever perception… whatever volitional formations were past, ceased, and changed: their arising was discerned, their passing away was discerned, and the alteration of their persistence was discerned. Whatever consciousness was past, ceased, and changed: its arising was discerned, its passing away was discerned, and the alteration of its persistence was discerned. Friends, of these phenomena the arising was discerned, the passing away was discerned, and the alteration of their persistence was discerned.’"

‘‘Yaṃ kho, āvuso, rūpaṃ ajātaṃ apātubhūtaṃ; tassa uppādo paññāyissati, vayo paññāyissati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyissati. Yā vedanā ajātā apātubhūtā; tassā uppādo paññāyissati, vayo paññāyissati, ṭhitāya aññathattaṃ paññāyissati. Yā saññā…pe… ye saṅkhārā ajātā apātubhūtā; tesaṃ uppādo paññāyissati, vayo paññāyissati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyissati. Yaṃ viññāṇaṃ ajātaṃ apātubhūtaṃ; tassa uppādo paññāyissati, vayo paññāyissati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyissati. Imesaṃ kho, āvuso, dhammānaṃ uppādo paññāyissati, vayo paññāyissati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyissati.

"Friend, as for form that is unborn and unmanifest: its arising will be discerned, its passing away will be discerned, and the alteration of its persistence will be discerned. As for feeling that is unborn and unmanifest: its arising will be discerned, its passing away will be discerned, and the alteration of its persistence will be discerned. As for perception… as for volitional formations that are unborn and unmanifest: their arising will be discerned, their passing away will be discerned, and the alteration of their persistence will be discerned. As for consciousness that is unborn and unmanifest: its arising will be discerned, its passing away will be discerned, and the alteration of its persistence will be discerned. Friends, the arising of these phenomena will be discerned, their passing away will be discerned, and the alteration of their persistence will be discerned."

‘‘Yaṃ kho, āvuso, rūpaṃ jātaṃ pātubhūtaṃ; tassa uppādo paññāyati, vayo paññāyati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyati. Yā vedanā jātā pātubhūtā…pe… yā saññā… ye saṅkhārā jātā pātubhūtā; tesaṃ uppādo paññāyati, vayo paññāyati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyati. Yaṃ viññāṇaṃ jātaṃ pātubhūtaṃ tassa uppādo paññāyati, vayo paññāyati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyati. Imesaṃ kho, āvuso, dhammānaṃ uppādo paññāyati, vayo paññāyati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyatī’ti. Evaṃ puṭṭhohaṃ, bhante, evaṃ byākareyya’’nti.

"Friend, as for form that has arisen and appeared: its arising is discerned, its passing away is discerned, and the alteration of its persistence is discerned. As for feeling that has arisen and appeared… as for perception… as for volitional formations that have arisen and appeared: their arising is discerned, their passing away is discerned, and the alteration of their persistence is discerned. As for consciousness that has arisen and appeared: its arising is discerned, its passing away is discerned, and the alteration of its persistence is discerned. Friends, the arising of these phenomena is discerned, their passing away is discerned, and the alteration of their persistence is discerned.’ Being asked thus, venerable sir, I would answer in this way."

‘‘Sādhu, sādhu, ānanda! Yaṃ kho, ānanda, rūpaṃ atītaṃ niruddhaṃ vipariṇataṃ; tassa uppādo paññāyittha, vayo paññāyittha, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyittha. Yā vedanā … yā saññā… ye saṅkhārā… yaṃ viññāṇaṃ atītaṃ niruddhaṃ vipariṇataṃ; tassa uppādo paññāyittha, vayo paññāyittha, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyittha. Imesaṃ kho, ānanda, dhammānaṃ uppādo paññāyittha, vayo paññāyittha, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyittha.

"Good, good, Ānanda! Whatever form, Ānanda, was past, ceased, and changed: its arising was discerned, its passing away was discerned, and the alteration of its persistence was discerned. Whatever feeling… whatever perception… whatever volitional formations… whatever consciousness was past, ceased, and changed: its arising was discerned, its passing away was discerned, and the alteration of its persistence was discerned. Ānanda, of these phenomena the arising was discerned, the passing away was discerned, and the alteration of their persistence was discerned."

‘‘Yaṃ kho, ānanda, rūpaṃ ajātaṃ apātubhūtaṃ; tassa uppādo paññāyissati, vayo paññāyissati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyissati. Yā vedanā… yā saññā… ye saṅkhārā… yaṃ viññāṇaṃ ajātaṃ apātubhūtaṃ; tassa uppādo paññāyissati, vayo paññāyissati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyissati. Imesaṃ kho, ānanda, dhammānaṃ uppādo paññāyissati, vayo paññāyissati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyissati.

"Ānanda, whatever form is unborn and unmanifest: its arising will be discerned, its passing away will be discerned, and the alteration of its persistence will be discerned. Whatever feeling… whatever perception… whatever volitional formations… whatever consciousness is unborn and unmanifest: its arising will be discerned, its passing away will be discerned, and the alteration of its persistence will be discerned. Ānanda, the arising of these phenomena will be discerned, their passing away will be discerned, and the alteration of their persistence will be discerned."

‘‘Yaṃ kho, ānanda, rūpaṃ jātaṃ pātubhūtaṃ; tassa uppādo paññāyati, vayo paññāyati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyati. Yā vedanā jātā pātubhūtā… yā saññā… ye saṅkhārā… yaṃ viññāṇaṃ jātaṃ pātubhūtaṃ; tassa uppādo paññāyati, vayo paññāyati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyati. Imesaṃ kho, ānanda, dhammānaṃ uppādo paññāyati, vayo paññāyati, ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyatīti. Evaṃ puṭṭho tvaṃ, ānanda, evaṃ byākareyyāsī’’ti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

"Ānanda, whatever form has arisen and appeared: its arising is discerned, its passing away is discerned, and the alteration of its persistence is discerned. Whatever feeling has arisen and appeared… whatever perception… whatever volitional formations… whatever consciousness has arisen and appeared: its arising is discerned, its passing away is discerned, and the alteration of its persistence is discerned. Ānanda, the arising of these phenomena is discerned, their passing away is discerned, and the alteration of their persistence is discerned.’ Ānanda, if you are asked like this, you should answer like this.” The Sixth.
