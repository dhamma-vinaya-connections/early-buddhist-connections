## SN 22.81 Pālileyya Sutta

81. Ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā kosambiyaṃ viharati ghositārāme. Atha kho bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya kosambiṃ piṇḍāya pāvisi. Kosambiyaṃ piṇḍāya caritvā pacchābhattaṃ piṇḍapātapaṭikkanto sāmaṃ senāsanaṃ saṃsāmetvā pattacīvaramādāya anāmantetvā upaṭṭhāke anapaloketvā bhikkhusaṅghaṃ eko adutiyo cārikaṃ pakkāmi.

81.At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One put on his robes, took his bowl and outer robe, and entered Kosambī for almsfood. After wandering for alms in Kosambī and returning from his alms round, when he had finished his meal, having put his lodging in order himself, he took his bowl and outer robe, and without informing his attendants or taking leave of the Bhikkhu Saṅgha, set out alone, without a companion, on a wandering tour.

Atha kho aññataro bhikkhu acirapakkantassa bhagavato yenāyasmā ānando tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘esāvuso, ānanda, bhagavā sāmaṃ senāsanaṃ saṃsāmetvā pattacīvaramādāya anāmantetvā upaṭṭhāke anapaloketvā bhikkhusaṅghaṃ eko adutiyo cārikaṃ pakkanto’’ti. ‘‘Yasmiṃ, āvuso, samaye bhagavā sāmaṃ senāsanaṃ saṃsāmetvā pattacīvaramādāya anāmantetvā upaṭṭhāke anapaloketvā bhikkhusaṅghaṃ eko adutiyo cārikaṃ pakkamati, ekova bhagavā tasmiṃ samaye viharitukāmo hoti; na bhagavā tasmiṃ samaye kenaci anubandhitabbo hotī’’ti.

Then a certain bhikkhu, not long after the Blessed One had departed, approached Venerable Ānanda; having approached, he said to Venerable Ānanda: “Friend Ānanda, the Blessed One himself has put his lodging in order, taken his bowl and outer robe, and without informing his attendants or taking leave of the Bhikkhu Saṅgha, has set out alone, without a companion, on a wandering tour.” “Friend, when the Blessed One himself puts his lodging in order, takes his bowl and outer robe, and without informing his attendants or taking leave of the Bhikkhu Saṅgha, sets out alone, without a companion, on a wandering tour, it is because the Blessed One wishes to dwell alone at that time; the Blessed One should not be followed by anyone at that time.”

Atha kho bhagavā anupubbena cārikaṃ caramāno yena pālileyyakaṃ [pārileyyakaṃ (sī. pī.)] tadavasari. Tatra sudaṃ bhagavā pālileyyake viharati bhaddasālamūle. Atha kho sambahulā bhikkhū yenāyasmā ānando tenupasaṅkamiṃsu; upasaṅkamitvā āyasmatā ānandena saddhiṃ sammodiṃsu. Sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu. Ekamantaṃ nisinnā kho te bhikkhū āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘cirassutā kho no, āvuso ānanda, bhagavato sammukhā dhammī kathā; icchāma mayaṃ, āvuso ānanda, bhagavato sammukhā dhammiṃ kathaṃ sotu’’nti.

Then the Blessed One, wandering by stages, arrived at Pālileyyaka. There the Blessed One dwelt at the root of a magnificent sal tree. Then a number of bhikkhus approached Venerable Ānanda; having approached, they exchanged greetings with Venerable Ānanda. When they had exchanged courteous greetings and converse, they sat down to one side. As they sat to one side, those bhikkhus said to Venerable Ānanda: “Friend Ānanda, it has been a long time since we heard a Dhamma talk from the Blessed One’s own lips. We wish to hear a Dhamma talk from the Blessed One’s own lips.”

Atha kho āyasmā ānando tehi bhikkhūhi saddhiṃ yena pālileyyakaṃ bhaddasālamūlaṃ yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinne kho te bhikkhū bhagavā dhammiyā kathāya sandassesi samādapesi samuttejesi sampahaṃsesi. Tena kho pana samayena aññatarassa bhikkhuno evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘‘kathaṃ nu kho jānato kathaṃ passato anantarā āsavānaṃ khayo hotī’’ti? Atha kho bhagavā tassa bhikkhuno cetasā cetoparivitakkamaññāya bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘vicayaso desito, bhikkhave, mayā dhammo; vicayaso desitā cattāro satipaṭṭhānā; vicayaso desitā cattāro sammappadhānā; vicayaso desitā cattāro iddhipādā; vicayaso desitāni pañcindriyāni; vicayaso desitāni pañca balāni; vicayaso desitā sattabojjhaṅgā; vicayaso desito ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo. Evaṃ vicayaso desito, bhikkhave, mayā dhammo. Evaṃ vicayaso desite kho, bhikkhave, mayā dhamme atha ca panidhekaccassa bhikkhuno evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘kathaṃ nu kho jānato kathaṃ passato anantarā āsavānaṃ khayo hotī’’’ti?

Then Venerable Ānanda, together with those bhikkhus, went to Pālileyyaka, to the root of the magnificent sal tree, where the Blessed One was. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat to one side. As they sat to one side, the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, and gladdened them with a Dhamma talk. Now on that occasion a certain bhikkhu had this thought arise in his mind: “How does one know, how does one see, for the destruction of the taints to be immediate?” Then the Blessed One, knowing with his mind the thought in that bhikkhu’s mind, addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, the Dhamma has been taught by me analytically; the four foundations of mindfulness have been taught analytically; the four right exertions have been taught analytically; the four bases of spiritual power have been taught analytically; the five faculties have been taught analytically; the five powers have been taught analytically; the seven factors of enlightenment have been taught analytically; the Noble Eightfold Path has been taught analytically. Thus, bhikkhus, the Dhamma has been taught by me analytically. Yet, though the Dhamma has been taught by me analytically, a certain bhikkhu here has this thought arise in his mind: ‘How does one know, how does one see, for the destruction of the taints to be immediate?’”

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, jānato kathaṃ passato anantarā āsavānaṃ khayo hoti? Idha bhikkhave, assutavā puthujjano ariyānaṃ adassāvī ariyadhammassa akovido ariyadhamme avinīto, sappurisānaṃ adassāvī sappurisadhammassa akovido sappurisadhamme avinīto rūpaṃ attato samanupassati. Yā kho pana sā, bhikkhave, samanupassanā saṅkhāro so. So pana saṅkhāro kiṃnidāno kiṃsamudayo kiṃjātiko kiṃpabhavo? Avijjāsamphassajena, bhikkhave, vedayitena phuṭṭhassa assutavato puthujjanassa uppannā taṇhā; tatojo so saṅkhāro. Iti kho, bhikkhave, sopi saṅkhāro anicco saṅkhato paṭiccasamuppanno. Sāpi taṇhā aniccā saṅkhatā paṭiccasamuppannā. Sāpi vedanā aniccā saṅkhatā paṭiccasamuppannā. Sopi phasso anicco saṅkhato paṭiccasamuppanno. Sāpi avijjā aniccā saṅkhatā paṭiccasamuppannā. Evampi kho, bhikkhave, jānato evaṃ passato anantarā āsavānaṃ khayo hoti.

“And how, bhikkhus, does one know and see for the destruction of the taints to be immediate? Here, bhikkhus, an uninstructed ordinary person, who is not conversant with the noble ones, unfamiliar with the Dhamma of the noble ones, and untrained in the Dhamma of the noble ones; who is not conversant with true men, unfamiliar with the Dhamma of true men, and untrained in the Dhamma of true men—regards form as self. That regarding, bhikkhus, is a formation. And what is the source of that formation, its origin, its birth, its coming-to-be? For an uninstructed ordinary person, touched by a feeling born of contact with ignorance, craving arises; that formation is born from that. Thus, bhikkhus, that formation too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That craving too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That feeling too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That contact too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That ignorance too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. Thus, bhikkhus, knowing thus, seeing thus, the destruction of the taints is immediate.

‘‘Na heva kho rūpaṃ attato samanupassati; api ca kho rūpavantaṃ attānaṃ samanupassati. Yā kho pana sā, bhikkhave, samanupassanā saṅkhāro so. So pana saṅkhāro kiṃnidāno kiṃsamudayo kiṃjātiko kiṃpabhavo? Avijjāsamphassajena, bhikkhave, vedayitena phuṭṭhassa assutavato puthujjanassa uppannā taṇhā; tatojo so saṅkhāro.

Evampi kho, bhikkhave, jānato evaṃ passato anantarā āsavānaṃ khayo hoti.

Or one does not regard form as self, but one regards the self as possessing form. That regarding, bhikkhus, is a formation. And what is the source of that formation, its origin, its birth, its coming-to-be? For an uninstructed ordinary person, touched by a feeling born of contact with ignorance, craving arises; that formation is born from that. Thus, bhikkhus, that formation too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That craving too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That feeling too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That contact too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That ignorance too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. Thus, bhikkhus, knowing thus, seeing thus, the destruction of the taints is immediate.

‘‘Na heva kho rūpaṃ attato samanupassati, na rūpavantaṃ attānaṃ samanupassati; api ca kho attani rūpaṃ samanupassati. Yā kho pana sā, bhikkhave, samanupassanā saṅkhāro so. So pana saṅkhāro kiṃnidāno kiṃsamudayo kiṃjātiko kiṃpabhavo? Avijjāsamphassajena, bhikkhave, vedayitena phuṭṭhassa assutavato puthujjanassa uppannā taṇhā; tatojo so saṅkhāro.

And what is the source of that formation, its origin, its birth, its coming-to-be? For an uninstructed ordinary person, touched by a feeling born of contact with ignorance, craving arises; that formation is born from that.

‘‘Na heva kho rūpaṃ attato samanupassati, na rūpavantaṃ attānaṃ samanupassati, na attani rūpaṃ samanupassati; api ca kho rūpasmiṃ attānaṃ samanupassati. Yā kho pana sā, bhikkhave, samanupassanā saṅkhāro so. So pana saṅkhāro kiṃnidāno kiṃsamudayo kiṃjātiko kiṃpabhavo?

Or one does not regard form as self, nor feeling as self, nor perception as self, nor formations as self, nor consciousness as self; but one regards feeling as self, or the self as possessing feeling, or feeling as in the self, or the self as in feeling; or one regards perception as self, or the self as possessing perception, or perception as in the self, or the self as in perception; or one regards formations as self, or the self as possessing formations, or formations as in the self, or the self as in formations; or one regards consciousness as self, or the self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or the self as in consciousness. That regarding, bhikkhus, is a formation. And what is the source of that formation, its origin, its birth, its coming-to-be? For an uninstructed ordinary person, touched by a feeling born of contact with ignorance, craving arises; that formation is born from that. Thus, bhikkhus, that formation too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That craving too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen.

Or one does not regard form as self, nor feeling as self, nor perception as self, nor formations as self, nor consciousness as self; but one holds such a view: ‘The self is the world, that I shall be after death, permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change.’ That eternalist view, bhikkhus, is a formation. And what is the source of that formation, its origin, its birth, its coming-to-be? For an uninstructed ordinary person, touched by a feeling born of contact with ignorance, craving arises; that formation is born from that. Thus, bhikkhus, that formation too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That craving too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen.

Or one does not regard form as self, nor feeling as self, nor perception as self, nor formations as self, nor consciousness as self; nor does one hold the view: ‘The self is the world, that I shall be after death, permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change.’ But one holds such a view: ‘I might not be, and it might not be mine; I shall not be, and it will not be mine.’ That annihilationist view, bhikkhus, is a formation. And what is the source of that formation, its origin, its birth, its coming-to-be? For an uninstructed ordinary person, touched by a feeling born of contact with ignorance, craving arises; that formation is born from that. Thus, bhikkhus, that formation too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That craving too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That feeling too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That contact too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That ignorance too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. Thus, bhikkhus, knowing thus, seeing thus, the destruction of the taints is immediate.

‘‘Na heva kho rūpaṃ attato samanupassati, na vedanaṃ… na saññaṃ… na saṅkhāre… na viññāṇaṃ attato samanupassati…pe… na viññāṇasmiṃ attato samanupassati, nāpi evaṃdiṭṭhi hoti – ‘so attā so loko, so pecca bhavissāmi nicco dhuvo sassato avipariṇāmadhammo’ti; nāpi evaṃdiṭṭhi hoti – ‘no cassaṃ no ca me siyā nābhavissaṃ na me bhavissatī’ti; api ca kho kaṅkhī hoti vicikicchī aniṭṭhaṅgato saddhamme. Yā kho pana sā, bhikkhave, kaṅkhitā vicikicchitā aniṭṭhaṅgatatā saddhamme saṅkhāro so. So pana saṅkhāro kiṃnidāno kiṃsamudayo kiṃjātiko kiṃpabhavo? Avijjāsamphassajena, bhikkhave, vedayitena phuṭṭhassa assutavato puthujjanassa uppannā taṇhā; tatojo so saṅkhāro. Iti kho, bhikkhave, sopi saṅkhāro anicco saṅkhato paṭiccasamuppanno.

Or one does not regard form as self, nor feeling as self, nor perception as self, nor formations as self, nor consciousness as self, nor the self as in consciousness; nor does one hold the view: ‘The self is the world, that I shall be after death, permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change’; nor does one hold the view: ‘I might not be, and it might not be mine; I shall not be, and it will not be mine’; but one is doubtful, perplexed, and unresolved regarding the True Dhamma. That doubt, perplexity, and unresolvedness regarding the True Dhamma, bhikkhus, is a formation. And what is the source of that formation, its origin, its birth, its coming-to-be? For an uninstructed ordinary person, touched by a feeling born of contact with ignorance, craving arises; that formation is born from that. Thus, bhikkhus, that formation too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That craving too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That feeling too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That contact too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. That ignorance too is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. Thus, bhikkhus, knowing thus, seeing thus, the destruction of the taints is immediate.” The Ninth.
