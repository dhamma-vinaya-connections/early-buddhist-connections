## SN 22.58 The Discourse on the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One

58. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. ‘‘Tathāgato, bhikkhave, arahaṃ sammāsambuddho rūpassa nibbidā virāgā nirodhā anupādā vimutto sammāsambuddhoti vuccati. Bhikkhupi, bhikkhave, paññāvimutto rūpassa nibbidā virāgā nirodhā anupādā vimutto paññāvimuttoti vuccati.

58.At Sāvatthī. “The Tathāgata, monks, an Arahant, a Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, is called a Perfectly Self-Enlightened One because he is liberated through dispassion for form, through its fading away, cessation, and relinquishment. A monk, monks, liberated by wisdom, is called one liberated by wisdom because he is liberated through dispassion for form, through its fading away, cessation, and relinquishment.”

‘‘Tathāgato, bhikkhave, arahaṃ sammāsambuddho vedanāya nibbidā virāgā nirodhā anupādā vimutto sammāsambuddhoti vuccati. Bhikkhupi, bhikkhave, paññāvimutto vedanāya nibbidā…pe… paññāvimuttoti vuccati.

“The Tathāgata, monks, an Arahant, a Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, is called a Perfectly Self-Enlightened One because he is liberated through dispassion for feeling, through its fading away, cessation, and relinquishment. A monk, monks, liberated by wisdom, is called one liberated by wisdom because he is liberated through dispassion for feeling, through its fading away, cessation, and relinquishment.”

‘‘Tathāgato, bhikkhave, arahaṃ sammāsambuddho saññāya… saṅkhārānaṃ… viññāṇassa nibbidā virāgā nirodhā anupādā vimutto sammāsambuddhoti vuccati. Bhikkhupi, bhikkhave, paññāvimutto viññāṇassa nibbidā virāgā nirodhā anupādā vimutto paññāvimuttoti vuccati.

“The Tathāgata, monks, an Arahant, a Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, is called a Perfectly Self-Enlightened One because he is liberated through dispassion for perception, through its fading away, cessation, and relinquishment; through dispassion for volitional formations, through their fading away, cessation, and relinquishment; through dispassion for consciousness, through its fading away, cessation, and relinquishment. A monk, monks, liberated by wisdom, is called one liberated by wisdom because he is liberated through dispassion for consciousness, through its fading away, cessation, and relinquishment.”

‘‘Tatra kho, bhikkhave, ko viseso, ko adhippayāso [adhippāyo (sī.), adhippāyaso (syā. kaṃ. pī. ka.)], kiṃ nānākaraṇaṃ, tathāgatassa arahato sammāsambuddhassa paññāvimuttena bhikkhunā’’ti? ‘‘Bhagavaṃmūlakā no, bhante, dhammā bhagavaṃnettikā bhagavaṃpaṭisaraṇā. Sādhu vata, bhante, bhagavantaññeva paṭibhātu etassa bhāsitassa attho. Bhagavato sutvā bhikkhū dhāressantī’’ti. ‘‘Tena hi, bhikkhave, suṇātha, sādhukaṃ manasi karotha; bhāsissāmī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti kho te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca –

“Here, monks, what is the distinction, what is the peculiarity, what is the difference between the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, and a monk liberated by wisdom?” “Venerable sir, our teachings have the Blessed One as their root, their guide, and their recourse. It would be good if the Blessed One himself would clarify the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the monks will remember it.” “Then listen, monks, attend closely; I will speak.” “So be it, venerable sir,” those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:

‘‘Tathāgato, bhikkhave, arahaṃ sammāsambuddho anuppannassa maggassa uppādetā, asañjātassa maggassa sañjanetā [sañjānetā (syā. kaṃ.)], anakkhātassa maggassa akkhātā maggaññū, maggavidū, maggakovido; maggānugā ca, bhikkhave, etarahi sāvakā viharanti pacchāsamannāgatā. Ayaṃ kho, bhikkhave, viseso, ayaṃ adhippayāso, idaṃ nānākaraṇaṃ tathāgatassa arahato sammāsambuddhassa paññāvimuttena bhikkhunā’’ti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

“The Tathāgata, monks, an Arahant, a Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, is the producer of the unproduced path, the generator of the ungenerated path, the proclaimer of the unproclaimed path. He is the knower of the path, the understander of the path, the expert in the path. And now, monks, his disciples dwell following the path, having come to follow it after him. This, monks, is the distinction, this is the peculiarity, this is the difference between the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, and a monk liberated by wisdom.” The Sixth.
