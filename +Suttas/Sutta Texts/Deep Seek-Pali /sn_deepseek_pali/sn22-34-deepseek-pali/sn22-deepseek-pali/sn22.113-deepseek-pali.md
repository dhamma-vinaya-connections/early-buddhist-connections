# SN 22.113 Avijjāsuttaṃ

## SN 22.113 The Discourse on Ignorance

113. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. Atha kho aññataro bhikkhu yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami…pe… ekamantaṃ nisinno kho so bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘‘avijjā avijjā’ti, bhante, vuccati. Katamā nu kho, bhante, avijjā, kittāvatā ca avijjāgato hotī’’ti? ‘‘Idha, bhikkhu, assutavā puthujjano rūpaṃ nappajānāti, rūpasamudayaṃ nappajānāti, rūpanirodhaṃ nappajānāti, rūpanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ nappajānāti; vedanaṃ nappajānāti… saññaṃ… saṅkhāre nappajānāti…pe… viññāṇanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ nappajānāti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhu, avijjā. Ettāvatā ca avijjāgato hotī’’ti. Paṭhamaṃ.

113.At Sāvatthī. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One and, having approached, sat down to one side. As he was sitting to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “‘Ignorance, ignorance,’ venerable sir, is said. What now, venerable sir, is ignorance, and to what extent does one come to be one who has gone to ignorance?” “Here, bhikkhu, the uninstructed ordinary person does not understand form, does not understand the origin of form, does not understand the cessation of form, does not understand the path leading to the cessation of form; does not understand feeling, does not understand the origin of feeling, does not understand the cessation of feeling, does not understand the path leading to the cessation of feeling; does not understand perception, does not understand the origin of perception, does not understand the cessation of perception, does not understand the path leading to the cessation of perception; does not understand formations, does not understand the origin of formations, does not understand the cessation of formations, does not understand the path leading to the cessation of formations; does not understand consciousness, does not understand the origin of consciousness, does not understand the cessation of consciousness, does not understand the path leading to the cessation of consciousness. This, bhikkhu, is called ignorance. To this extent one comes to be one who has gone to ignorance.” The First.
