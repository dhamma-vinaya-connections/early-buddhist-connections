93. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. ‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, nadī pabbateyyā ohārinī dūraṅgamā sīghasotā. Tassā ubhosu tīresu [ubhato tīre (sī.), ubhato tīresu (syā. kaṃ.)] kāsā cepi jātā assu, te naṃ ajjholambeyyuṃ; kusā cepi jātā assu, te naṃ ajjholambeyyuṃ; pabbajā [babbajā (sī. pī.)] cepi jātā assu, te naṃ ajjholambeyyuṃ; bīraṇā cepi jātā assu, te naṃ ajjholambeyyuṃ; rukkhā cepi jātā assu, te naṃ ajjholambeyyuṃ. Tassā puriso sotena vuyhamāno kāse cepi gaṇheyya, te palujjeyyuṃ. So tatonidānaṃ anayabyasanaṃ āpajjeyya. Kuse cepi gaṇheyya, pabbaje cepi gaṇheyya, bīraṇe cepi gaṇheyya, rukkhe cepi gaṇheyya, te palujjeyyuṃ. So tatonidānaṃ anayabyasanaṃ āpajjeyya. Evameva kho, bhikkhave, assutavā puthujjano ariyānaṃ adassāvī ariyadhammassa akovido ariyadhamme avinīto, sappurisānaṃ adassāvī sappurisadhammassa akovido sappurisadhamme avinīto rūpaṃ attato samanupassati, rūpavantaṃ vā attānaṃ; attani vā rūpaṃ, rūpasmiṃ vā attānaṃ. Tassa taṃ rūpaṃ palujjati. So tatonidānaṃ anayabyasanaṃ āpajjati. Vedanaṃ… saññaṃ… saṅkhāre… viññāṇaṃ attato samanupassati, viññāṇavantaṃ vā attānaṃ; attani vā viññāṇaṃ, viññāṇasmiṃ vā attānaṃ. Tassa taṃ viññāṇaṃ palujjati. So tatonidānaṃ anayabyasanaṃ āpajjati. Taṃ kiṃ maññatha, bhikkhave, rūpaṃ niccaṃ vā aniccaṃ vā’’ti? ‘‘Aniccaṃ bhante’’. ‘‘Vedanā… saññā… saṅkhārā… viññāṇaṃ niccaṃ vā aniccaṃ vā’’ti? ‘‘Aniccaṃ bhante’’. ‘‘Tasmātiha…pe… evaṃ passaṃ…pe… nāparaṃ itthattāyāti pajānātī’’ti. Paṭhamaṃ.

93.At Sāvatthī. “Just as, monks, a river from the mountains, sweeping down, far-reaching, swift-flowing—if on both its banks kāsa grass were to grow, they would overhang it; if kusa grass were to grow, they would overhang it; if pabbaja grass were to grow, they would overhang it; if bīraṇa grass were to grow, they would overhang it; if trees were to grow, they would overhang it. If a man being carried along by the current were to grab hold of the kāsa grass, it would collapse, and he would thereby come to ruin and disaster. If he were to grab hold of the kusa grass, the pabbaja grass, the bīraṇa grass, or the trees, they would collapse, and he would thereby come to ruin and disaster. In the same way, monks, an uninstructed ordinary person—who has not seen the noble ones, is unskilled and undisciplined in the Dhamma of the noble ones; who has not seen the good persons, is unskilled and undisciplined in the Dhamma of the good persons—regards form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. That form of his disintegrates, and he thereby comes to ruin and disaster. He regards feeling as self, or self as possessing feeling, or feeling as in self, or self as in feeling. That feeling of his disintegrates, and he thereby comes to ruin and disaster. He regards perception as self, or self as possessing perception, or perception as in self, or self as in perception. That perception of his disintegrates, and he thereby comes to ruin and disaster. He regards volitional formations as self, or self as possessing volitional formations, or volitional formations as in self, or self as in volitional formations. Those volitional formations of his disintegrate, and he thereby comes to ruin and disaster. He regards consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. That consciousness of his disintegrates, and he thereby comes to ruin and disaster. What do you think, monks, is form permanent or impermanent?” “Impermanent, venerable sir.” “Is feeling permanent or impermanent? Is perception permanent or impermanent? Are volitional formations permanent or impermanent? Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?” “Impermanent, venerable sir.” “Therefore… seeing thus… he understands: ‘…there is no more for this state of being.’” The first.
