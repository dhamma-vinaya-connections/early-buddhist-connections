# SN 22.126 Samudayadhammasuttaṃ

## SN 22.126 The Discourse on Things Subject to Arising

126. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. Atha kho aññataro bhikkhu yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā…pe… ekamantaṃ nisinno kho so bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘‘avijjā avijjā’ti, bhante, vuccati. Katamā nu kho, bhante, avijjā, kittāvatā ca avijjāgato hotī’’ti?

126.At Sāvatthī. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, and having approached… he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: “‘Ignorance, ignorance,’ Bhante, it is said. What, Bhante, is ignorance? And to what extent is one immersed in ignorance?”

‘‘Idha, bhikkhu, assutavā puthujjano samudayadhammaṃ rūpaṃ ‘samudayadhammaṃ rūpa’nti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti; vayadhammaṃ rūpaṃ ‘vayadhammaṃ rūpa’nti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti; samudayavayadhammaṃ rūpaṃ ‘samudayavayadhammaṃ rūpa’nti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Samudayadhammaṃ vedanaṃ ‘samudayadhammā vedanā’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti; vayadhammaṃ vedanaṃ ‘vayadhammā vedanā’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti; samudayavayadhammaṃ vedanaṃ ‘samudayavayadhammā vedanā’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Samudayadhammaṃ saññaṃ…pe… samudayadhamme saṅkhāre ‘samudayadhammā saṅkhārā’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti; vayadhamme saṅkhāre ‘vayadhammā saṅkhārā’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti; samudayavayadhamme saṅkhāre ‘samudayavayadhammā saṅkhārā’ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Samudayadhammaṃ viññāṇaṃ ‘samudayadhammaṃ viññāṇa’nti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti; vayadhammaṃ viññāṇaṃ ‘vayadhammaṃ viññāṇa’nti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti; samudayavayadhammaṃ viññāṇaṃ ‘samudayavayadhammaṃ viññāṇa’nti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhu, avijjā; ettāvatā ca avijjāgato hotī’’ti.

“Here, bhikkhu, an uninstructed ordinary person does not understand form as subject to arising, ‘Form is subject to arising,’ as it actually is; does not understand form as subject to vanishing, ‘Form is subject to vanishing,’ as it actually is; does not understand form as subject to arising and vanishing, ‘Form is subject to arising and vanishing,’ as it actually is. They do not understand feeling as subject to arising, ‘Feeling is subject to arising,’ as it actually is; do not understand feeling as subject to vanishing, ‘Feeling is subject to vanishing,’ as it actually is; do not understand feeling as subject to arising and and vanishing, ‘Feeling is subject to arising and vanishing,’ as it actually is. They do not understand perception… and so forth… They do not understand volitional formations as subject to arising, ‘Volitional formations are subject to arising,’ as it actually is; do not understand volitional formations as subject to vanishing, ‘Volitional formations are subject to vanishing,’ as it actually is; do not understand volitional formations as subject to arising and vanishing, ‘Volitional formations are subject to arising and vanishing,’ as it actually is. They do not understand consciousness as subject to arising, ‘Consciousness is subject to arising,’ as it actually is; do not understand consciousness as subject to vanishing, ‘Consciousness is subject to vanishing,’ as it actually is; do not understand consciousness as subject to arising and vanishing, ‘Consciousness is subject to arising and vanishing,’ as it actually is. This, bhikkhu, is called ignorance; and to this extent one is immersed in ignorance.”

Evaṃ vutte, so bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘‘vijjā vijjā’ti, bhante, vuccati. Katamā nu kho, bhante, vijjā, kittāvatā ca vijjāgato hotī’’ti?

When this was said, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “‘Knowledge, knowledge,’ Bhante, it is said. What, Bhante, is knowledge? And to what extent has one arrived at knowledge?”

‘‘Idha, bhikkhu, sutavā ariyasāvako samudayadhammaṃ rūpaṃ ‘samudayadhammaṃ rūpa’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti; vayadhammaṃ rūpaṃ ‘vayadhammaṃ rūpa’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti; samudayavayadhammaṃ rūpaṃ ‘samudayavayadhammaṃ rūpa’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Samudayadhammaṃ vedanaṃ ‘samudayadhammā vedanā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti; vayadhammaṃ vedanaṃ ‘vayadhammā vedanā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti; samudayavayadhammaṃ vedanaṃ ‘samudayavayadhammā vedanā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Samudayadhammaṃ saññaṃ… samudayadhamme saṅkhāre ‘samudayadhammā saṅkhārā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti; vayadhamme saṅkhāre ‘vayadhammā saṅkhārā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti; samudayavayadhamme saṅkhāre ‘samudayavayadhammā saṅkhārā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Samudayadhammaṃ viññāṇaṃ ‘samudayadhammaṃ viññāṇa’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti; vayadhammaṃ viññāṇaṃ ‘vayadhammaṃ viññāṇa’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti; samudayavayadhammaṃ viññāṇaṃ ‘samudayavayadhammaṃ viññāṇa’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhu, vijjā; ettāvatā ca vijjāgato hotī’’ti. Paṭhamaṃ.

“Here, bhikkhu, an instructed noble disciple understands form as subject to arising, ‘Form is subject to arising,’ as it actually is; understands form as subject to vanishing, ‘Form is subject to vanishing,’ as it actually is; understands form as subject to arising and vanishing, ‘Form is subject to arising and vanishing,’ as it actually is. He understands feeling as subject to arising, ‘Feeling is subject to arising,’ as it actually is; understands feeling as subject to vanishing, ‘Feeling is subject to vanishing,’ as it actually is; understands feeling as subject to arising and vanishing, ‘Feeling is subject to arising and vanishing,’ as it actually is. He understands perception… and so forth… He understands volitional formations as subject to arising, ‘Volitional formations are subject to arising,’ as it actually is; understands volitional formations as subject to vanishing, ‘Volitional formations are subject to vanishing,’ as it actually is; understands volitional formations as subject to arising and vanishing, ‘Volitional formations are subject to arising and vanishing,’ as it actually is. He understands consciousness as subject to arising, ‘Consciousness is subject to arising,’ as it actually is; understands consciousness as subject to vanishing, ‘Consciousness is subject to vanishing,’ as it actually is; understands consciousness as subject to arising and vanishing, ‘Consciousness is subject to arising and vanishing,’ as it actually is. This, bhikkhu, is called knowledge; and to this extent one has arrived at knowledge.” The first.
