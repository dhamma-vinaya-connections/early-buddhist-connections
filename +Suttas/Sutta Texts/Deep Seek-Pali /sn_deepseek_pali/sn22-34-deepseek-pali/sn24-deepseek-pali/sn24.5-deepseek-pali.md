## SN 24.5 The 'No Giving' Discourse

210. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. ‘‘Kismiṃ nu kho, bhikkhave, sati kiṃ upādāya, kiṃ abhinivissa evaṃ diṭṭhi uppajjati – ‘natthi dinnaṃ, natthi yiṭṭhaṃ, natthi hutaṃ, natthi sukatadukkaṭānaṃ [sukkaṭadukkaṭānaṃ (sī. pī.)] kammānaṃ phalaṃ vipāko; natthi ayaṃ loko, natthi paro loko, natthi mātā, natthi pitā, natthi sattā opapātikā; natthi loke samaṇabrāhmaṇā sammaggatā [samaggatā (ka.)] sammāpaṭipannā ye imañca lokaṃ parañca lokaṃ sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedenti. Cātumahābhūtiko [cātummahābhūtiko (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] ayaṃ puriso yadā kālaṅkaroti pathavī pathavīkāyaṃ anupeti anupagacchati, āpo āpokāyaṃ anupeti anupagacchati, tejo tejokāyaṃ anupeti anupagacchati, vāyo vāyokāyaṃ anupeti anupagacchati. Ākāsaṃ indriyāni saṅkamanti. Āsandipañcamā purisā mataṃ ādāya gacchanti. Yāva āḷāhanā padāni paññāyanti. Kāpotakāni aṭṭhīni bhavanti. Bhassantā āhutiyo. Dattupaññattaṃ yadidaṃ dānaṃ [dattupaññattamidaṃ dānaṃ nāma (sabbattha)]. Tesaṃ tucchaṃ musā vilāpo ye keci atthikavādaṃ vadanti. Bāle ca paṇḍite ca kāyassa bhedā ucchijjanti vinassanti na honti paraṃ maraṇā’’’ti? Bhagavaṃmūlakā no, bhante, dhammā…pe… ‘‘rūpe kho, bhikkhave, sati, rūpaṃ upādāya, rūpaṃ abhinivissa evaṃ diṭṭhi uppajjati – ‘natthi dinnaṃ, natthi yiṭṭhaṃ…pe… kāyassa bhedā ucchijjanti vinassanti na honti paraṃ maraṇā’ti. Vedanāya sati…pe… saññāya sati… saṅkhāresu sati… viññāṇe sati, viññāṇaṃ upādāya, viññāṇaṃ abhinivissa evaṃ diṭṭhi uppajjati – ‘natthi dinnaṃ, natthi yiṭṭhaṃ…pe… kāyassa bhedā ucchijjanti vinassanti na honti paraṃ maraṇā’’’ti.

210.At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, when what exists, by clinging to what, by adhering to what, does such a view arise: ‘There is no giving, no sacrifice, no offering; there is no fruit or result of good or bad deeds; there is no this world, no other world; there is no mother, no father; there are no spontaneously born beings; there are no ascetics or brahmins in the world who are rightly attained and rightly practiced, who have realized for themselves by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world. This person is made of the four great elements. When he dies, the earth element returns to the earth element, the water element returns to the water element, the fire element returns to the fire element, and the air element returns to the air element. The sense faculties pass into space. The bier is the fifth, and men carry the corpse away. Tracks are seen as far as the cremation ground. The bones become dove-colored. Offerings become ashes. Giving is a mere convention established by fools. Whoever speak of what exists, their talk is empty and false babble. Both fools and wise, with the breakup of the body, are cut off, perish, and do not exist after death’?" "Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One…" "Bhikkhus, when form exists, by clinging to form, by adhering to form, such a view arises: 'There is no giving…and do not exist after death.' When feeling exists… When perception exists… When volitional formations exist… When consciousness exists, by clinging to consciousness, by adhering to consciousness, such a view arises: 'There is no giving… and do not exist after death.'"

‘‘Taṃ kiṃ maññatha, bhikkhave, rūpaṃ niccaṃ vā aniccaṃ vā’’ti? ‘‘Aniccaṃ, bhante…pe… api nu taṃ anupādāya evaṃ diṭṭhi uppajjeyya – ‘natthi dinnaṃ, natthi yiṭṭhaṃ…pe… kāyassa bhedā ucchijjanti vinassanti na honti paraṃ maraṇā’’’ti? ‘‘No hetaṃ, bhante’’. ‘‘Vedanā… saññā… saṅkhārā… viññāṇaṃ niccaṃ vā aniccaṃ vā’’ti? ‘‘Aniccaṃ, bhante…pe… api nu taṃ anupādāya evaṃ diṭṭhi uppajjeyya – ‘natthi dinnaṃ, natthi yiṭṭhaṃ…pe… kāyassa bhedā ucchijjanti vinassanti na honti paraṃ maraṇā’’’ti? ‘‘No hetaṃ, bhante’’. ‘‘Yampidaṃ diṭṭhaṃ sutaṃ mutaṃ viññātaṃ pattaṃ pariyesitaṃ anuvicaritaṃ manasā tampi niccaṃ vā aniccaṃ vā’’ti? ‘‘Aniccaṃ, bhante…pe… api nu taṃ anupādāya evaṃ diṭṭhi uppajjeyya – ‘natthi dinnaṃ, natthi yiṭṭhaṃ…pe… ye keci atthikavādaṃ vadanti; bāle ca paṇḍite ca kāyassa bhedā ucchijjanti vinassanti na honti paraṃ maraṇā’’’ti? ‘‘No hetaṃ, bhante’’.

"What do you think, monks, is form permanent or impermanent?" "Impermanent, venerable sir." … "Then, could such a view arise without clinging: ‘There is no giving, no sacrifice, no offering; there is no fruit or result of good or bad deeds; there is no this world, no other world; there is no mother, no father; there are no spontaneously born beings; there are no ascetics or brahmins in the world who are rightly attained and rightly practiced, who have realized for themselves by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world.

Giving is a mere convention established by fools. Whoever speak of what exists, their talk is empty and false babble. Both fools and wise, with the breakup of the body, are cut off, perish, and do not exist after death’?" "No, venerable sir." "Is feeling… perception… volitional formations… consciousness permanent or impermanent?" "Impermanent, venerable sir." … "Then, could such a view arise without clinging: ‘There is no giving, no sacrifice, no offering; there is no fruit or result of good or bad deeds; there is no this world, no other world; there is no mother, no father; there are no spontaneously born beings; there are no ascetics or brahmins in the world who are rightly attained and rightly practiced, who have realized for themselves by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world.

"Impermanent, venerable sir." … "Then, could such a view arise without clinging: ‘There is no giving, no sacrifice, no offering; there is no fruit or result of good or bad deeds; there is no this world, no other world; there is no mother, no father; there are no spontaneously born beings; there are no ascetics or brahmins in the world who are rightly attained and rightly practiced, who have realized for themselves by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world.

‘‘Yato kho, bhikkhave, ariyasāvakassa imesu ca ṭhānesu kaṅkhā pahīnā hoti, dukkhepissa kaṅkhā pahīnā hoti…pe… dukkhanirodhagāminiyā paṭipadāyapissa kaṅkhā pahīnā hoti – ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako sotāpanno avinipātadhammo niyato sambodhiparāyano’’ti. Pañcamaṃ.

"Monks, when a noble disciple has abandoned doubt in these aspects, has abandoned doubt in suffering, … has abandoned doubt in the path leading to the cessation of suffering—this, monks, is called a noble disciple who is a stream-enterer, not subject to falling away, assured, headed for enlightenment." Fifth.
