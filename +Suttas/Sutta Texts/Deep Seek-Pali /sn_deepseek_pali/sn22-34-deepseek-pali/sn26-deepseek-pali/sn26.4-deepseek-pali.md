Whatever is the arising, persistence, production, and manifestation of ear-contact… of nose-contact… of tongue-contact… of body-contact… Whatever is the arising, persistence, production, and manifestation of mind-contact is the arising of suffering, the persistence of diseases, and the manifestation of aging and death. And, bhikkhus, whatever is the cessation, fading away, and disappearance of eye-contact is the cessation of suffering, the fading away of diseases, and the disappearance of aging and death. Whatever is the cessation, fading away, and disappearance of ear-contact… of nose-contact… of tongue-contact… of body-contact… Whatever is the cessation, fading away, and disappearance of mind-contact is the cessation of suffering, the fading away of diseases, and the disappearance of aging and death.” The Fourth.
