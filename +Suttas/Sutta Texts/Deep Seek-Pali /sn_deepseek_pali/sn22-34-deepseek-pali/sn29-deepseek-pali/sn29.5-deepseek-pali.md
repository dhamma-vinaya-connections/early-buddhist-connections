# SN 29.5 Tatiyauposathasuttaṃ

## SN 29.5 Third Uposatha

346. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho so bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘ko nu kho, bhante, hetu, ko paccayo, yena midhekacce saṃsedajā nāgā uposathaṃ upavasanti vossaṭṭhakāyā ca bhavantī’’ti? ‘‘Idha, bhikkhu…pe… ayaṃ kho, bhikkhu, hetu, ayaṃ paccayo, yena midhekacce saṃsedajā nāgā uposathaṃ upavasanti vossaṭṭhakāyā ca bhavantī’’ti. Pañcamaṃ.

346.At Sāvatthī. Sitting to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “What now, venerable sir, is the cause, what is the reason, why some moisture-born nāgas observe the Uposatha and become with relinquished bodies?” “Here, bhikkhu, some moisture-born nāgas think thus: ‘In the past we engaged in twofold conduct by body, twofold conduct by speech, twofold conduct by mind. Because we engaged in twofold conduct by body, speech, and mind, after death, with the breakup of the body, we were reborn into the company of moisture-born nāgas. If today we were to practice good conduct by body, good conduct by speech, good conduct by mind, then after death, with the breakup of the body, we may be reborn in a good destination, a heavenly world. Come now, let us from now on practice good conduct by body, speech, and mind.’ This, bhikkhu, is the cause, this is the reason, why some moisture-born nāgas observe the Uposatha and become with relinquished bodies.” Fifth.
