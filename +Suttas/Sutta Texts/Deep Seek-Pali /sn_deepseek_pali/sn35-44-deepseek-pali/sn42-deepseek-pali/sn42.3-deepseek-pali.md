## SN 42.3 The Discourse on the Warrior

355. Atha kho yodhājīvo gāmaṇi yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā…pe… ekamantaṃ nisinno kho yodhājīvo gāmaṇi bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sutaṃ metaṃ, bhante, pubbakānaṃ ācariyapācariyānaṃ yodhājīvānaṃ bhāsamānānaṃ – ‘yo so yodhājīvo saṅgāme ussahati vāyamati, tamenaṃ ussahantaṃ vāyamantaṃ pare hananti pariyāpādenti, so kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā parajitānaṃ devānaṃ sahabyataṃ upapajjatī’ti. Idha bhagavā kimāhā’’ti? ‘‘Alaṃ, gāmaṇi, tiṭṭhatetaṃ; mā maṃ etaṃ pucchī’’ti. Dutiyampi kho…pe… tatiyampi kho yodhājīvo gāmaṇi bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sutaṃ metaṃ, bhante, pubbakānaṃ ācariyapācariyānaṃ yodhājīvānaṃ bhāsamānānaṃ – ‘yo so yodhājīvo saṅgāme ussahati vāyamati, tamenaṃ ussahantaṃ vāyamantaṃ pare hananti pariyāpādenti, so kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā parajitānaṃ devānaṃ sahabyataṃ upapajjatī’ti. Idha bhagavā kimāhā’’ti?

355.Then the headman Yodhājīva approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the headman Yodhājīva said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, I have heard this said by the ancient teachers and instructors of warriors: ‘A warrior who strives and exerts himself in battle—if others kill him and slay him while he is striving and exerting himself, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the gods of the vanquished.’ What does the Blessed One say about this?” “Enough, headman, let that be. Do not ask me that.” A second time the headman Yodhājīva said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, I have heard this said by the ancient teachers and instructors of warriors: ‘A warrior who strives and exerts himself in battle—if others kill him and slay him while he is striving and exerting himself, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the gods of the vanquished.’ What does the Blessed One say about this?” A third time the headman Yodhājīva said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, I have heard this said by the ancient teachers and instructors of warriors: ‘A warrior who strives and exerts himself in battle—if others kill him and slay him while he is striving and exerting himself, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the gods of the vanquished.’ What does the Blessed One say about this?”

‘‘Addhā kho tyāhaṃ, gāmaṇi, na labhāmi – ‘alaṃ, gāmaṇi, tiṭṭhatetaṃ; mā maṃ etaṃ pucchī’ti. Api ca tyāhaṃ byākarissāmi. Yo so, gāmaṇi, yodhājīvo saṅgāme ussahati vāyamati, tassa taṃ cittaṃ pubbe gahitaṃ [hīnaṃ (sī. pī.)] dukkaṭaṃ duppaṇihitaṃ – ‘ime sattā haññantu vā bajjhantu vā ucchijjantu vā vinassantu vā mā vā ahesuṃ iti vā’ti. Tamenaṃ ussahantaṃ vāyamantaṃ pare hananti pariyāpādenti; so kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā parajito nāma nirayo tattha upapajjatīti. Sace kho panassa evaṃ diṭṭhi hoti – ‘yo so yodhājīvo saṅgāme ussahati vāyamati tamenaṃ ussahantaṃ vāyamantaṃ pare hananti pariyāpādenti, so kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā parajitānaṃ devānaṃ sahabyataṃ upapajjatī’ti, sāssa hoti micchādiṭṭhi. Micchādiṭṭhikassa kho panāhaṃ, gāmaṇi, purisapuggalassa dvinnaṃ gatīnaṃ aññataraṃ gatiṃ vadāmi – nirayaṃ vā tiracchānayoniṃ vā’’ti.

“Certainly, headman, I cannot say to you: ‘Enough, headman, let that be; do not ask me that.’ Nevertheless, I will explain it to you. When a warrior, earning his living by war, strives and exerts himself in battle, his mind is already seized, evilly conceived, and wrongly directed thus: ‘May these beings be struck down, slaughtered, annihilated, destroyed, or may they not exist at all.’ If others then strike him down and slay him while he is striving and exerting himself, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the hell called ‘Defeated’. But if he holds such a view as this: ‘A warrior who strives and exerts himself in battle—if others then strike him down and slay him while he is striving and exerting himself, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the gods of the vanquished’—that is his wrong view. For a person with wrong view, headman, I say there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal realm.”

Evaṃ vutte, yodhājīvo gāmaṇi parodi, assūni pavattesi. ‘‘Etaṃ kho tyāhaṃ, gāmaṇi, nālatthaṃ – ‘alaṃ, gāmaṇi, tiṭṭhatetaṃ; mā maṃ etaṃ pucchī’’’ti. ‘‘Nāhaṃ, bhante, etaṃ rodāmi yaṃ maṃ bhagavā evamāha; apicāhaṃ, bhante, pubbakehi ācariyapācariyehi yodhājīvehi dīgharattaṃ nikato vañcito paluddho – ‘yo so yodhājīvo saṅgāme ussahati vāyamati, tamenaṃ ussahantaṃ vāyamantaṃ pare hananti pariyāpādenti, so kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā parajitānaṃ devānaṃ sahabyataṃ upapajjatī’’’ti. ‘‘Abhikkantaṃ, bhante…pe… ajjatagge pāṇupetaṃ saraṇaṃ gata’’nti. Tatiyaṃ.

When this was said, the headman Yodhājīva wept and shed tears. “It is just this I did not obtain from you, headman—‘Enough, headman, let it be; do not ask me this.’” “I am not weeping, venerable sir, because the Blessed One said this to me. But rather, venerable sir, I have been deceived, cheated, and deluded for a long time by former teachers and instructors of the warrior class, saying: ‘That warrior who strives and exerts himself in battle, they kill him and slay him as he strives and exerts himself, and with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn into the company of the gods of the vanquished.’” “Excellent, venerable sir!… From this day forward, may the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” The Third.
