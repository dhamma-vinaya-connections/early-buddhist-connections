## SN 42.4 The Discourse on the Elephant Rider

356. Atha kho hatthāroho gāmaṇi yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā…pe… ajjatagge pāṇupetaṃ saraṇaṃ gatanti. Catutthaṃ.

356.Then the headman, the elephant rider, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the headman, the elephant rider, said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, I have heard this said by the ancient teachers and instructors of elephant riders: ‘An elephant rider who strives and exerts himself in battle—if others kill him and slay him while he is striving and exerting himself, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the gods of the vanquished.’ What does the Blessed One say about this?” “Enough, headman, let that be. Do not ask me that.” A second time the headman, the elephant rider, said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, I have heard this said by the ancient teachers and instructors of elephant riders: ‘An elephant rider who strives and exerts himself in battle—if others kill him and slay him while he is striving and exerting himself, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the gods of the vanquished.’ What does the Blessed One say about this?” A third time the headman, the elephant rider, said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, I have heard this said by the ancient teachers and instructors of elephant riders: ‘An elephant rider who strives and exerts himself in battle—if others kill him and slay him while he is striving and exerting himself, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the gods of the vanquished.’ What does the Blessed One say about this?” When this was said, the headman, the elephant rider, wept and shed tears. “It is just this I did not obtain from you, headman—‘Enough, headman, let it be; do not ask me this.’” “I am not weeping, venerable sir, because the Blessed One said this to me. But rather, venerable sir, I have been deceived, cheated, and deluded for a long time by former teachers and instructors of elephant riders, saying: ‘That elephant rider who strives and exerts himself in battle, they kill him and slay him as he strives and exerts himself, and with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn into the company of the gods of the vanquished.’” “Excellent, venerable sir!… From this day forward, may the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” The Fourth.
