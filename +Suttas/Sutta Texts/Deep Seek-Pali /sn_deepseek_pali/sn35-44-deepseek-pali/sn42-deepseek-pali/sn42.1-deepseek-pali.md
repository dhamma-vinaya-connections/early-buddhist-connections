# SN 42.1 Caṇḍasuttaṃ

## SN 42.1 The Discourse on Caṇḍa

353. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. Atha kho caṇḍo gāmaṇi yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho caṇḍo gāmaṇi bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘ko nu kho, bhante, hetu, ko paccayo yena midhekacco caṇḍo caṇḍotveva [yena midhekacco caṇḍoteva (sī. pī.)] saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Ko pana, bhante, hetu, ko paccayo yena midhekacco sorato soratotveva [yena midhekacco suratoteva (sī. pī.)] saṅkhaṃ gacchatī’’ti? ‘‘Idha, gāmaṇi, ekaccassa rāgo appahīno hoti. Rāgassa appahīnattā pare kopenti, parehi kopiyamāno kopaṃ pātukaroti. So caṇḍotveva saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Doso appahīno hoti. Dosassa appahīnattā pare kopenti, parehi kopiyamāno kopaṃ pātukaroti. So caṇḍotveva saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Moho appahīno hoti. Mohassa appahīnattā pare kopenti, parehi kopiyamāno kopaṃ pātukaroti. So caṇḍotveva saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Ayaṃ kho, gāmaṇi, hetu, ayaṃ paccayo yena midhekacco caṇḍo caṇḍotveva saṅkhaṃ gacchati’’.

353.At Sāvatthī. Then the village headman Caṇḍa approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the village headman Caṇḍa said to the Blessed One: "What, venerable sir, is the cause, what is the reason why someone here is reckoned as 'violent'? And what, venerable sir, is the cause, what is the reason why someone here is reckoned as 'gentle'?" "Here, headman, in some person lust is not abandoned. Because lust is not abandoned, others provoke him, and being provoked by others, he manifests anger. He is reckoned as 'violent.' Hatred is not abandoned. Because hatred is not abandoned, others provoke him, and being provoked by others, he manifests anger. He is reckoned as 'violent.' Delusion is not abandoned. Because delusion is not abandoned, others provoke him, and being provoked by others, he manifests anger. He is reckoned as 'violent.' This, headman, is the cause, this is the reason why someone here is reckoned as 'violent.'"

‘‘Idha pana, gāmaṇi, ekaccassa rāgo pahīno hoti. Rāgassa pahīnattā pare na kopenti, parehi kopiyamāno kopaṃ na pātukaroti. So soratotveva saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Doso pahīno hoti. Dosassa pahīnattā pare na kopenti, parehi kopiyamāno kopaṃ na pātukaroti. So soratotveva saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Moho pahīno hoti. Mohassa pahīnattā pare na kopenti, parehi kopiyamāno kopaṃ na pātukaroti. So soratotveva saṅkhaṃ gacchati. Ayaṃ kho, gāmaṇi, hetu ayaṃ paccayo yena midhekacco sorato soratotveva saṅkhaṃ gacchatī’’ti.

"Here, headman, in some person lust has been abandoned. Because of the abandoning of lust, they do not provoke others, and when provoked by others, they do not manifest anger. They are reckoned simply as gentle. Hatred has been abandoned. Because of the abandoning of hatred, they do not provoke others, and when provoked by others, they do not manifest anger. They are reckoned simply as gentle. Delusion has been abandoned. Because of the abandoning of delusion, they do not provoke others, and when provoked by others, they do not manifest anger. They are reckoned simply as gentle. This, headman, is the cause and reason why someone here is reckoned simply as gentle."

Evaṃ vutte, caṇḍo gāmaṇi bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘abhikkantaṃ, bhante, abhikkantaṃ, bhante! Seyyathāpi, bhante, nikkujjitaṃ vā ukkujjeyya, paṭicchannaṃ vā vivareyya, mūḷhassa vā maggaṃ ācikkheyya, andhakāre vā telapajjotaṃ dhāreyya – cakkhumanto rūpāni dakkhantīti; evamevaṃ bhagavatā anekapariyāyena dhammo pakāsito. Esāhaṃ, bhante, bhagavantaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi dhammañca bhikkhusaṅghañca. Upāsakaṃ maṃ bhagavā dhāretu ajjatagge pāṇupetaṃ saraṇaṃ gata’’nti. Paṭhamaṃ.

When this was said, Caṇḍa the headman said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, venerable sir! Excellent, venerable sir! Just as one might set upright what was overturned, reveal what was hidden, show the way to one who is lost, or hold up a lamp in the darkness, so that those with eyes might see forms—so has the Blessed One made the Dhamma clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for as long as life lasts." First.
