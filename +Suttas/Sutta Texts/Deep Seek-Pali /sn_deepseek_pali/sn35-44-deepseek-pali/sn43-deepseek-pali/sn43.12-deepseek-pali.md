377."Monks, I will teach you the unconditioned and the path leading to the unconditioned. Listen to it. And what, monks, is the unconditioned? The destruction of greed, the destruction of hate, the destruction of delusion—this is called, monks, the unconditioned. And what, monks, is the path leading to the unconditioned? Serenity.

Whatever a teacher, out of compassion and desiring the welfare of his disciples, should do, that has been done by me for you. These are roots of trees, monks, these are empty dwellings. Meditate, monks, do not be heedless, lest you regret it later. This is our instruction to you."
