160.On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in Jīvaka’s Mango Grove. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus…” … “Develop concentration, bhikkhus. For a bhikkhu who is concentrated, bhikkhus, things are discerned as they really are. And what does he discern as it really is? He discerns as it really is: ‘The eye is impermanent.’ He discerns as it really is: ‘Forms are impermanent.’ He discerns as it really is: ‘Eye-consciousness is impermanent.’ He discerns as it really is: ‘Eye-contact is impermanent.’ He discerns as it really is: ‘Whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-unpleasant—that too is impermanent.’ … He discerns as it really is: ‘The tongue is impermanent.’ … He discerns as it really is: ‘The mind is impermanent.’ He discerns as it really is: ‘Mental phenomena are impermanent.’ … He discerns as it really is: ‘Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-unpleasant—that too is impermanent.’ Develop concentration, bhikkhus. For a bhikkhu who is concentrated, bhikkhus, things are discerned as they really are.” The fifth.
