Evaṃ puṭṭhā tumhe, bhikkhave, tesaṃ aññatitthiyānaṃ paribbājakānaṃ evaṃ byākareyyātha – ‘dukkhassa kho, āvuso, pariññāya bhagavati brahmacariyaṃ vussatī’ti. Sace pana vo, bhikkhave, aññatitthiyā paribbājakā evaṃ puccheyyuṃ – ‘katamaṃ panāvuso, dukkhaṃ, yassa pariññāya samaṇe gotame brahmacariyaṃ vussatī’ti?

152.“Monks, if wanderers of other sects should ask you: ‘For what purpose, friends, is the holy life lived under the Recluse Gotama?’—being asked thus, monks, you should answer those wanderers of other sects thus: ‘For the full understanding of suffering, friends, the holy life is lived under the Blessed One.’ If then, monks, wanderers of other sects should ask you: ‘But what, friends, is that suffering for the full understanding of which the holy life is lived under the Recluse Gotama?’—being asked thus, monks, you should answer those wanderers of other sects thus:

‘‘Cakkhu kho, āvuso, dukkhaṃ; tassa pariññāya bhagavati brahmacariyaṃ vussati. Rūpā dukkhā; tesaṃ pariññāya bhagavati brahmacariyaṃ vussati. Cakkhuviññāṇaṃ dukkhaṃ; tassa pariññāya bhagavati brahmacariyaṃ vussati. Cakkhusamphasso dukkho; tassa pariññāya bhagavati brahmacariyaṃ vussati. Yampidaṃ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi dukkhaṃ; tassa pariññāya bhagavati brahmacariyaṃ vussati…pe… jivhā dukkhā… mano dukkho; tassa pariññāya bhagavati brahmacariyaṃ vussati…pe… yampidaṃ manosamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi dukkhaṃ; tassa pariññāya bhagavati brahmacariyaṃ vussati. Idaṃ kho, āvuso, dukkhaṃ; yassa pariññāya bhagavati brahmacariyaṃ vussatī’ti. Evaṃ puṭṭhā tumhe, bhikkhave, tesaṃ aññatitthiyānaṃ paribbājakānaṃ evaṃ byākareyyāthā’’ti. Sattamaṃ.

‘Friends, the eye is suffering; for its full understanding the holy life is lived under the Blessed One. Forms are suffering; for their full understanding the holy life is lived under the Blessed One. Eye-consciousness is suffering; for its full understanding the holy life is lived under the Blessed One. Eye-contact is suffering; for its full understanding the holy life is lived under the Blessed One. Whatever feeling arises dependent on eye-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor unpleasant—that too is suffering; for its full understanding the holy life is lived under the Blessed One. … The tongue is suffering … the mind is suffering; for its full understanding the holy life is lived under the Blessed One. … Whatever feeling arises dependent on mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor unpleasant—that too is suffering; for its full understanding the holy life is lived under the Blessed One. This, friends, is suffering; for its full understanding the holy life is lived under the Blessed One.’ Being asked thus, monks, you should answer those wanderers of other sects in this way. The seventh.
