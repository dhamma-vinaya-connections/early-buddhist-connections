## SN 35.121 The Discourse on the Cause of Internal Impermanence

140. ‘‘Cakkhuṃ, bhikkhave, aniccaṃ. Yopi hetu, yopi paccayo cakkhussa uppādāya, sopi anicco. Aniccasambhūtaṃ, bhikkhave, cakkhu kuto niccaṃ bhavissati…pe… jivhā aniccā. Yopi hetu, yopi paccayo jivhāya uppādāya sopi anicco. Aniccasambhūtā, bhikkhave, jivhā kuto niccā bhavissati…pe… mano anicco. Yopi, bhikkhave, hetu yopi paccayo manassa uppādāya, sopi anicco. Aniccasambhūto, bhikkhave, mano kuto nicco bhavissati! Evaṃ passaṃ, bhikkhave, sutavā ariyasāvako cakkhusmimpi nibbindati…pe… jivhāyapi nibbindati…pe… nibbindaṃ virajjati; virāgā vimuccati; vimuttasmiṃ vimuttamiti ñāṇaṃ hoti. ‘Khīṇā jāti, vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ, kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ, nāparaṃ itthattāyā’ti pajānātī’’ti. Sattamaṃ.

140."The eye, monks, is impermanent. Whatever the cause, whatever the condition for the arising of the eye, that too is impermanent. The eye, monks, arisen from what is impermanent, how could it be permanent?... The tongue is impermanent. Whatever the cause, whatever the condition for the arising of the tongue, that too is impermanent. The tongue, monks, arisen from what is impermanent, how could it be permanent?... The mind is impermanent. Whatever the cause, whatever the condition for the arising of the mind, that too is impermanent. The mind, monks, arisen from what is impermanent, how could it be permanent! Seeing thus, monks, the learned noble disciple becomes disenchanted with the eye... becomes disenchanted with the tongue... becomes disenchanted with the mind. Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is liberated. When liberated, there is the knowledge: 'Liberated.' He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to this state of being.'" The seventh.
