# SN 35.15 Paṭhamaassādapariyesanasuttaṃ

## SN 35.15 The First Discourse on the Pursuit of Gratification.

15. ‘‘Cakkhussāhaṃ, bhikkhave, assādapariyesanaṃ acariṃ. Yo cakkhussa assādo tadajjhagamaṃ. Yāvatā cakkhussa assādo paññāya me so sudiṭṭho. Cakkhussāhaṃ, bhikkhave, ādīnavapariyesanaṃ acariṃ. Yo cakkhussa ādīnavo tadajjhagamaṃ. Yāvatā cakkhussa ādīnavo paññāya me so sudiṭṭho. Cakkhussāhaṃ, bhikkhave, nissaraṇapariyesanaṃ acariṃ. Yaṃ cakkhussa nissaraṇaṃ tadajjhagamaṃ. Yāvatā cakkhussa nissaraṇaṃ, paññāya me taṃ sudiṭṭhaṃ. Sotassāhaṃ, bhikkhave… ghānassāhaṃ, bhikkhave… jivhāyāhaṃ bhikkhave, assādapariyesanaṃ acariṃ. Yo jivhāya assādo tadajjhagamaṃ. Yāvatā jivhāya assādo paññāya me so sudiṭṭho. Jivhāyāhaṃ, bhikkhave, ādīnavapariyesanaṃ acariṃ. Yo jivhāya ādīnavo tadajjhagamaṃ. Yāvatā jivhāya ādīnavo paññāya me so sudiṭṭho. Jivhāyāhaṃ, bhikkhave, nissaraṇapariyesanaṃ acariṃ. Yaṃ jivhāya nissaraṇaṃ tadajjhagamaṃ. Yāvatā jivhāya nissaraṇaṃ, paññāya me taṃ sudiṭṭhaṃ. Manassāhaṃ, bhikkhave, assādapariyesanaṃ acariṃ. Yo manassa assādo tadajjhagamaṃ. Yāvatā manassa assādo paññāya me so sudiṭṭho. Manassāhaṃ, bhikkhave, ādīnavapariyesanaṃ acariṃ. Yo manassa ādīnavo tadajjhagamaṃ. Yāvatā manassa ādīnavo paññāya me so sudiṭṭho. Manassāhaṃ, bhikkhave, nissaraṇapariyesanaṃ acariṃ. Yaṃ manassa nissaraṇaṃ tadajjhagamaṃ. Yāvatā manassa nissaraṇaṃ, paññāya me taṃ sudiṭṭhaṃ.

15. Monks, I have pursued the gratification in the eye. Whatever gratification there is in the eye—that I have attained. To the extent of the gratification in the eye, it has been well seen by me with wisdom. Monks, I have pursued the danger in the eye. Whatever danger there is in the eye—that I have attained. To the extent of the danger in the eye, it has been well seen by me with wisdom. Monks, I have pursued the escape from the eye. Whatever escape there is from the eye—that I have attained. To the extent of the escape from the eye, it has been well seen by me with wisdom. Monks, I have pursued the gratification in the ear... the nose... the tongue. Monks, I have pursued the gratification in the tongue. Whatever gratification there is in the tongue—that I have attained. To the extent of the gratification in the tongue, it has been well seen by me with wisdom. Monks, I have pursued the danger in the tongue. Whatever danger there is in the tongue—that I have attained. To the extent of the danger in the tongue, it has been well seen by me with wisdom. Monks, I have pursued the escape from the tongue. Whatever escape there is from the tongue—that I have attained. To the extent of the escape from the tongue, it has been well seen by me with wisdom. Monks, I have pursued the gratification in the mind. Whatever gratification there is in the mind—that I have attained. To the extent of the gratification in the mind, it has been well seen by me with wisdom. Monks, I have pursued the danger in the mind. Whatever danger there is in the mind—that I have attained. To the extent of the danger in the mind, it has been well seen by me with wisdom. Monks, I have pursued the escape from the mind. Whatever escape there is from the mind—that I have attained. To the extent of the escape from the mind, it has been well seen by me with wisdom.

‘‘Yāvakīvañcāhaṃ, bhikkhave, imesaṃ channaṃ ajjhattikānaṃ āyatanānaṃ assādañca assādato, ādīnavañca ādīnavato, nissaraṇañca nissaraṇato yathābhūtaṃ nābbhaññāsiṃ…pe… paccaññāsiṃ. Ñāṇañca pana me dassanaṃ udapādi – ‘akuppā me vimutti, ayamantimā jāti, natthi dāni punabbhavo’’’ti. Tatiyaṃ.

Monks, as long as I did not directly know, as it truly is, the gratification in these six internal sense bases as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape as escape, so long I did not claim to have awakened to unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas, Māras, and Brahmās, in this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its devas and humans.
But when I did directly know, as it truly is, the gratification in these six internal sense bases as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape as escape, then I claimed to have awakened to unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas, Māras, and Brahmās, in this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its devas and humans.
Then there arose in me knowledge and vision: ‘Unshakable is my liberation, this is my last birth, now there is no more renewed existence.’ (Third Discourse)
