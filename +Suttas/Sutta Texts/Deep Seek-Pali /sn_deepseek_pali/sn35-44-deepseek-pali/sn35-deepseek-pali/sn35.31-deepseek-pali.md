Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu cakkhuṃ na maññati, cakkhusmiṃ na maññati, cakkhuto na maññati, cakkhuṃ meti na maññati.

Navamaṃ.

31.“Monks, I will teach you the practice conducive to the uprooting of all conceiving. Listen to it. And what, monks, is that practice conducive to the uprooting of all conceiving? Here, monks, a monk does not conceive the eye, does not conceive in the eye, does not conceive from the eye, does not conceive ‘the eye is mine.’ He does not conceive forms…eye-consciousness…eye-contact…and whatever feeling arises dependent on eye-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—he does not conceive that, does not conceive in that, does not conceive from that, does not conceive ‘that is mine.’ For whatever one conceives, whatever one conceives in, whatever one conceives from, whatever one conceives as ‘mine’—from that it becomes otherwise. The world, though subject to change, is attached to existence and delights in existence.… He does not conceive the tongue, does not conceive in the tongue, does not conceive from the tongue, does not conceive ‘the tongue is mine.’ He does not conceive tastes…tongue-consciousness…tongue-contact…and whatever feeling arises dependent on tongue-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—he does not conceive that, does not conceive in that, does not conceive from that, does not conceive ‘that is mine.’ For whatever one conceives, whatever one conceives in, whatever one conceives from, whatever one conceives as ‘mine’—from that it becomes otherwise. The world, though subject to change, is attached to existence and delights in existence.… He does not conceive the mind, does not conceive in the mind, does not conceive from the mind, does not conceive ‘the mind is mine.’ He does not conceive mental objects…mind-consciousness…mind-contact…and whatever feeling arises dependent on mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—he does not conceive that, does not conceive in that, does not conceive from that, does not conceive ‘that is mine.’ For whatever one conceives, whatever one conceives in, whatever one conceives from, whatever one conceives as ‘mine’—from that it becomes otherwise. The world, though subject to change, is attached to existence and delights in existence. As far as the aggregates, elements, and sense bases extend, he does not conceive that, does not conceive in that, does not conceive from that, does not conceive ‘that is mine.’ Not conceiving thus, he does not cling to anything in the world. Not clinging, he is not agitated. Being unagitated, he personally attains Nibbāna. He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’ This, monks, is the practice conducive to the uprooting of all conceiving.” The Ninth.
