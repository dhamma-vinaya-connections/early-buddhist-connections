# SN 35.146 Micchādiṭṭhipahānasuttaṃ

## SN 35.146 The Discourse on Abandoning Wrong View

165. Atha kho aññataro bhikkhu yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami…pe… ekamantaṃ nisinno so bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kathaṃ nu kho, bhante, jānato kathaṃ passato micchādiṭṭhi pahīyatī’’ti?

165.Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One… and, having approached, sat down to one side. Seated to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “But how, venerable sir, by knowing, how by seeing, is wrong view abandoned?”

‘‘Cakkhuṃ kho, bhikkhu, aniccato jānato passato micchādiṭṭhi pahīyati. Rūpe aniccato jānato passato micchādiṭṭhi pahīyati. Cakkhuviññāṇaṃ aniccato jānato passato micchādiṭṭhi pahīyati. Cakkhusamphassaṃ aniccato jānato passato micchādiṭṭhi pahīyati…pe… yampidaṃ manosamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi aniccato jānato passato micchādiṭṭhi pahīyati. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhu, jānato evaṃ passato micchādiṭṭhi pahīyatī’’ti. Dasamaṃ.

“Bhikkhu, by knowing and seeing the eye as impermanent, wrong view is abandoned. By knowing and seeing forms as impermanent, wrong view is abandoned. By knowing and seeing eye-consciousness as impermanent, wrong view is abandoned. By knowing and seeing eye-contact as impermanent, wrong view is abandoned… And whatever feeling arises conditioned by mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—by knowing and seeing that too as impermanent, wrong view is abandoned. It is in this way, bhikkhu, by knowing and seeing thus, that wrong view is abandoned.” The Tenth.
