## SN 35.72 The Second Discourse on Craving

91. ‘‘Ejā, bhikkhave, rogo, ejā gaṇḍo, ejā sallaṃ. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, tathāgato anejo viharati vītasallo. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu cepi ākaṅkheyya ‘anejo vihareyyaṃ vītasallo’ti, cakkhuṃ na maññeyya, cakkhusmiṃ na maññeyya, cakkhuto na maññeyya, cakkhu meti na maññeyya; rūpe na maññeyya… cakkhuviññāṇaṃ… cakkhusamphassaṃ… yampidaṃ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi na maññeyya, tasmimpi na maññeyya, tatopi na maññeyya, taṃ meti na maññeyya. Yañhi, bhikkhave, maññati, yasmiṃ maññati, yato maññati, yaṃ meti maññati, tato taṃ hoti aññathā. Aññathābhāvī bhavasatto loko bhavameva abhinandati…pe….

91.Craving, Bhikkhus, is a disease, craving is a tumor, craving is a dart. Therefore, Bhikkhus, the Tathagata dwells without craving, with the dart removed. Therefore, Bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu should wish, 'May I dwell without craving, with the dart removed,' he should not conceive the eye, should not conceive in the eye, should not conceive from the eye, should not conceive, 'The eye is mine.' He should not conceive forms... eye-consciousness... eye-contact... whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither pleasant nor painful—he should not conceive that, should not conceive in that, should not conceive from that, should not conceive, 'That is mine.' For whatever one conceives, whatever one conceives in, whatever one conceives from, whatever one conceives as 'mine'—that becomes other. The world, attached to becoming, delights in becoming.

‘‘Jivhaṃ na maññeyya, jivhāya na maññeyya, jivhāto na maññeyya, jivhā meti na maññeyya; rase na maññeyya… jivhāviññāṇaṃ… jivhāsamphassaṃ… yampidaṃ jivhāsamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi na maññeyya, tasmimpi na maññeyya, tatopi na maññeyya, taṃ meti na maññeyya. Yañhi, bhikkhave, maññati, yasmiṃ maññati, yato maññati, yaṃ meti maññati, tato taṃ hoti aññathā. Aññathābhāvī bhavasatto loko bhavameva abhinandati…pe….

One should not conceive the tongue, should not conceive in the tongue, should not conceive from the tongue, should not conceive, 'The tongue is mine.' One should not conceive tastes... tongue-consciousness... tongue-contact... whatever feeling arises with tongue-contact as condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither pleasant nor painful—one should not conceive that, should not conceive in that, should not conceive from that, should not conceive, 'That is mine.' For, Bhikkhus, whatever one conceives, whatever one conceives in, whatever one conceives from, whatever one conceives as 'mine'—that becomes other. The world, attached to becoming, delights in becoming.

‘‘Manaṃ na maññeyya, manasmiṃ na maññeyya, manato na maññeyya, mano meti na maññeyya… manoviññāṇaṃ… manosamphassaṃ… yampidaṃ manosamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi na maññeyya, tasmimpi na maññeyya, tatopi na maññeyya, taṃ meti na maññeyya. Yañhi, bhikkhave, maññati, yasmiṃ maññati, yato maññati, yaṃ meti maññati, tato taṃ hoti aññathā. Aññathābhāvī bhavasatto loko bhavameva abhinandati.

One should not conceive mind, should not conceive in mind, should not conceive from mind, should not conceive, 'Mind is mine.' Mind-consciousness... mind-contact... whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither pleasant nor painful—one should not conceive that, should not conceive in that, should not conceive from that, should not conceive, 'That is mine.' For, Bhikkhus, whatever one conceives, whatever one conceives in, whatever one conceives from, whatever one conceives as 'mine'—that becomes other. The world, attached to becoming, delights in becoming.

‘‘Yāvatā, bhikkhave, khandhadhātuāyatanā tampi na maññeyya, tasmimpi na maññeyya, tatopi na maññeyya, taṃ meti na maññeyya. So evaṃ amaññamāno na kiñci loke upādiyati. Anupādiyaṃ na paritassati. Aparitassaṃ paccattaññeva parinibbāyati. ‘Khīṇā jāti, vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ, kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ, nāparaṃ itthattāyā’ti pajānātī’’ti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

Bhikkhus, as far as the aggregates, elements, and sense bases are concerned, one should not conceive of them, should not conceive in relation to them, should not conceive as apart from them, should not conceive, 'They are mine.' Not conceiving thus, one does not cling to anything in the world. Not clinging, one is not agitated. Being unagitated, one personally attains Nibbāna. One understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more return to any state of being.'" The eighth.
