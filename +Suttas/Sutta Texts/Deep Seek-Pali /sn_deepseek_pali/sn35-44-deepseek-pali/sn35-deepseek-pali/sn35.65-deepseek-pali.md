## SN 35.65 The Discourse on What Is Subject to Dissolution

84. Sāvatthinidānaṃ. Atha kho āyasmā ānando yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami…pe… ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā ānando bhagavantaṃ etadavoca –

84.At Sāvatthī. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One…and, having taken a seat to one side, said to the Blessed One:

‘‘‘Loko, loko’ti, bhante, vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, lokoti vuccatī’’ti? ‘‘Yaṃ kho, ānanda, palokadhammaṃ, ayaṃ vuccati ariyassa vinaye loko. Kiñca, ānanda, palokadhammaṃ? Cakkhu kho, ānanda, palokadhammaṃ, rūpā palokadhammā, cakkhuviññāṇaṃ palokadhammaṃ, cakkhusamphasso palokadhammo, yampidaṃ cakkhusamphassapaccayā…pe… tampi palokadhammaṃ…pe… jivhā palokadhammā, rasā palokadhammā, jivhāviññāṇaṃ palokadhammaṃ, jivhāsamphasso palokadhammo, yampidaṃ jivhāsamphassapaccayā…pe… tampi palokadhammaṃ…pe… mano palokadhammo, dhammā palokadhammā, manoviññāṇaṃ palokadhammaṃ, manosamphasso palokadhammo, yampidaṃ manosamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi palokadhammaṃ. Yaṃ kho, ānanda, palokadhammaṃ, ayaṃ vuccati ariyassa vinaye loko’’ti. Paṭhamaṃ.

“‘The world, the world,’ it is said, venerable sir. To what extent, venerable sir, is it called ‘the world’?” “That which is subject to dissolution, Ānanda, is called ‘the world’ in the Noble One’s Discipline. And what, Ānanda, is subject to dissolution? The eye, Ānanda, is subject to dissolution; forms are subject to dissolution; eye-consciousness is subject to dissolution; eye-contact is subject to dissolution; and whatever feeling arises dependent on eye-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is subject to dissolution. The ear is subject to dissolution; sounds are subject to dissolution; ear-consciousness is subject to dissolution; ear-contact is subject to dissolution; and whatever feeling arises dependent on ear-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is subject to dissolution. The nose is subject to dissolution; odours are subject to dissolution; nose-consciousness is subject to dissolution; nose-contact is subject to dissolution; and whatever feeling arises dependent on nose-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is subject to dissolution. The tongue is subject to dissolution; flavours are subject to dissolution; tongue-consciousness is subject to dissolution; tongue-contact is subject to dissolution; and whatever feeling arises dependent on tongue-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is subject to dissolution. The body is subject to dissolution; tangible objects are subject to dissolution; body-consciousness is subject to dissolution; body-contact is subject to dissolution; and whatever feeling arises dependent on body-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is subject to dissolution. The mind is subject to dissolution; mental objects are subject to dissolution; mind-consciousness is subject to dissolution; mind-contact is subject to dissolution; and whatever feeling arises dependent on mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is subject to dissolution. That which is subject to dissolution, Ānanda, is called ‘the world’ in the Noble One’s Discipline.” The First.
