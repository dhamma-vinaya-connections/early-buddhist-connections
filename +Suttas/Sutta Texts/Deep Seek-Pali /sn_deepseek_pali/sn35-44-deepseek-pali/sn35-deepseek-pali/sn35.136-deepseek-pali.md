# SN 35.136 Dhammakathikapucchasuttaṃ

## SN 35.136 The Discourse on the Question to the Dhamma Speaker

155. Atha kho aññataro bhikkhu yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami…pe… ekamantaṃ nisinno kho so bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘‘dhammakathiko, dhammakathiko’ti, bhante, vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, dhammakathiko hotī’’ti?

155.Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One… and, on arrival, having bowed to the Blessed One, he sat down to one side. Seated to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, it is said, ‘a Dhamma speaker, a Dhamma speaker.’ To what extent, venerable sir, is one a Dhamma speaker?”

‘‘Cakkhussa ce, bhikkhu nibbidāya virāgāya nirodhāya dhammaṃ deseti, ‘dhammakathiko bhikkhū’ti alaṃvacanāya. Cakkhussa ce, bhikkhu, nibbidāya virāgāya nirodhāya paṭipanno hoti, ‘dhammānudhammappaṭipanno bhikkhū’ti alaṃvacanāya. Cakkhussa ce, bhikkhu, nibbidā virāgā nirodhā anupādāvimutto hoti, ‘diṭṭhadhammanibbānappatto bhikkhū’ti alaṃvacanāya…pe… jivhāya ce, bhikkhu, nibbidāya virāgāya nirodhāya dhammaṃ deseti, ‘dhammakathiko bhikkhū’ti alaṃvacanāya…pe… manassa ce, bhikkhu, nibbidāya virāgāya nirodhāya dhammaṃ deseti, ‘dhammakathiko bhikkhū’ti alaṃvacanāya. Manassa ce, bhikkhu, nibbidāya virāgāya nirodhāya paṭipanno hoti, ‘dhammānudhammappaṭipanno bhikkhū’ti alaṃvacanāya. Manassa ce, bhikkhu, nibbidā virāgā nirodhā anupādāvimutto hoti, ‘diṭṭhadhammanibbānappatto bhikkhū’ti alaṃvacanāyā’’ti. Dasamaṃ.

“Bhikkhu, if a bhikkhu teaches the Dhamma for disenchantment with the eye, for its dispassion, for its cessation, it is fitting to call him ‘a Dhamma speaker.’ If a bhikkhu practices for disenchantment with the eye, for its dispassion, for its cessation, it is fitting to call him ‘a practitioner in accordance with the Dhamma.’ If a bhikkhu is liberated through non-clinging by means of disenchantment with the eye, dispassion, and cessation, it is fitting to call him ‘one who has attained Nibbāna in this very life.’
…If a bhikkhu teaches the Dhamma for disenchantment with the tongue, for its dispassion, for its cessation, it is fitting to call him ‘a Dhamma speaker.’…
…If a bhikkhu teaches the Dhamma for disenchantment with the mind, for its dispassion, for its cessation, it is fitting to call him ‘a Dhamma speaker.’ If a bhikkhu practices for disenchantment with the mind, for its dispassion, for its cessation, it is fitting to call him ‘a practitioner in accordance with the Dhamma.’ If a bhikkhu is liberated through non-clinging by means of disenchantment with the mind, dispassion, and cessation, it is fitting to call him ‘one who has attained Nibbāna in this very life.’ ” This is the tenth.
