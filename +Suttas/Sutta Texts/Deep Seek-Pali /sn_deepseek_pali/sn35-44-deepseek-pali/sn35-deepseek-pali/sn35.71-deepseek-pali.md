## SN 35.71 The First Discourse on Craving

90. ‘‘Ejā, bhikkhave, rogo, ejā gaṇḍo, ejā sallaṃ. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, tathāgato anejo viharati vītasallo. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu cepi ākaṅkheyya ‘anejo vihareyyaṃ [vihareyya (sī. pī. ka.)] vītasallo’ti, cakkhuṃ na maññeyya, cakkhusmiṃ na maññeyya, cakkhuto na maññeyya, cakkhu meti na maññeyya; rūpe na maññeyya, rūpesu na maññeyya, rūpato na maññeyya, rūpā meti na maññeyya; cakkhuviññāṇaṃ na maññeyya, cakkhuviññāṇasmiṃ na maññeyya, cakkhuviññāṇato na maññeyya, cakkhuviññāṇaṃ meti na maññeyya; cakkhusamphassaṃ na maññeyya, cakkhusamphassasmiṃ na maññeyya, cakkhusamphassato na maññeyya, cakkhusamphasso meti na maññeyya. Yampidaṃ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi na maññeyya, tasmimpi na maññeyya, tatopi na maññeyya, taṃ meti na maññeyya.

90."Monks, craving is a disease, craving is a tumor, craving is a dart. Therefore, monks, the Tathagata dwells without craving, with the dart removed. Therefore, monks, if a monk should wish, 'May I dwell without craving, with the dart removed,' he should not conceive the eye, should not conceive in the eye, should not conceive from the eye, should not conceive, 'The eye is mine.' He should not conceive forms, should not conceive in forms, should not conceive from forms, should not conceive, 'Forms are mine.' He should not conceive eye-consciousness, should not conceive in eye-consciousness, should not conceive from eye-consciousness, should not conceive, 'Eye-consciousness is mine.' He should not conceive eye-contact, should not conceive in eye-contact, should not conceive from eye-contact, should not conceive, 'Eye-contact is mine.' And whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—pleasant, painful, or neither pleasant nor painful—he should not conceive that, should not conceive in that, should not conceive from that, should not conceive, 'That is mine.'"

‘‘Sotaṃ na maññeyya…pe… ghānaṃ na maññeyya…pe… jivhaṃ na maññeyya, jivhāya na maññeyya, jivhāto na maññeyya, jivhā meti na maññeyya; rase na maññeyya…pe… jivhāviññāṇaṃ na maññeyya…pe… jivhāsamphassaṃ na maññeyya…pe… yampidaṃ jivhāsamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi na maññeyya, tasmimpi na maññeyya, tatopi na maññeyya, taṃ meti na maññeyya.

"He should not conceive the ear… He should not conceive the nose… He should not conceive the tongue, should not conceive in the tongue, should not conceive from the tongue, should not conceive, ‘The tongue is mine.’ He should not conceive tastes… He should not conceive tongue-consciousness… He should not conceive tongue-contact… And whatever feeling arises with tongue-contact as condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither pleasant nor painful—he should not conceive that, should not conceive in that, should not conceive from that, should not conceive, ‘That is mine.’"

‘‘Kāyaṃ na maññeyya…pe… manaṃ na maññeyya, manasmiṃ na maññeyya, manato na maññeyya, mano meti na maññeyya; dhamme na maññeyya…pe… mano viññāṇaṃ…pe… manosamphassaṃ…pe… yampidaṃ manosamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi na maññeyya, tasmimpi na maññeyya, tatopi na maññeyya, taṃ meti na maññeyya; sabbaṃ na maññeyya, sabbasmiṃ na maññeyya, sabbato na maññeyya, sabbaṃ meti na maññeyya.

"He should not conceive the body… He should not conceive the mind, should not conceive in the mind, should not conceive from the mind, should not conceive, ‘The mind is mine.’ He should not conceive mental phenomena… He should not conceive mind-consciousness… He should not conceive mind-contact… And whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither pleasant nor painful—he should not conceive that, should not conceive in that, should not conceive from that, should not conceive, ‘That is mine.’ He should not conceive all, should not conceive in all, should not conceive from all, should not conceive, ‘All is mine.’"

‘‘So evaṃ amaññamāno na kiñcipi loke upādiyati. Anupādiyaṃ na paritassati. Aparitassaṃ paccattaññeva parinibbāyati. ‘Khīṇā jāti, vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ, kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ nāparaṃ itthattāyā’ti pajānātī’’ti. Sattamaṃ.

"So, not conceiving in this way, he does not cling to anything in the world. Not clinging, he is not agitated. Being unagitated, he personally attains Nibbāna. He understands: 'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.' Seventh."
