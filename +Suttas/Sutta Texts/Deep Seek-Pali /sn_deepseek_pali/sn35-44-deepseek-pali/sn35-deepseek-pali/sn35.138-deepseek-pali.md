## SN 35.138 The Discourse on the Dissolution of External Delight

157. ‘‘Anicceyeva, bhikkhave, bhikkhu rūpe aniccāti passati, sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi. Sammā passaṃ nibbindati. Nandikkhayā rāgakkhayo; rāgakkhayā nandikkhayo. Nandirāgakkhayā cittaṃ suvimuttanti vuccati. Anicceyeva, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sadde… gandhe… rase… phoṭṭhabbe… dhamme aniccāti passati, sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi. Sammā passaṃ nibbindati. Nandikkhayā rāgakkhayo; rāgakkhayā nandikkhayo. Nandirāgakkhayā cittaṃ suvimuttanti vuccatī’’ti. Dutiyaṃ.

With the fading of delight comes the fading of lust; with the fading of lust comes the fading of delight. With the fading of delight and lust, the mind is said to be well liberated.
