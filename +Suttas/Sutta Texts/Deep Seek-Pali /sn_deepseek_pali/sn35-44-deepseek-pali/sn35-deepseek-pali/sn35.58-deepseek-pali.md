# SN 35.58 Rādhadukkhasuttaṃ

## SN 35.58 The Discourse to Rādhā on Suffering.

77. ‘‘Yaṃ kho, rādha, dukkhaṃ tatra te chando pahātabbo. Kiñca, rādha, dukkhaṃ? Cakkhu kho, rādha, dukkhaṃ. Tatra te chando pahātabbo. Rūpā… cakkhuviññāṇaṃ… cakkhusamphasso… yampidaṃ cakkhusamphassa…pe… adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi dukkhaṃ. Tatra te chando pahātabbo…pe… mano dukkho… dhammā… manoviññāṇaṃ… manosamphasso… yampidaṃ manosamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi dukkhaṃ. Tatra te chando pahātabbo. Yaṃ kho, rādha, dukkhaṃ tatra te chando pahātabbo’’ti. Catutthaṃ.

77.“Rādhā, whatever is suffering, there your desire should be abandoned. And what, Rādhā, is suffering? The eye, Rādhā, is suffering. There your desire should be abandoned. Forms… eye-consciousness… eye-contact… whatever feeling arises conditioned by eye-contact—be it pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is suffering. There your desire should be abandoned… The mind is suffering… mental phenomena… mind-consciousness… mind-contact… whatever feeling arises conditioned by mind-contact—be it pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is suffering. There your desire should be abandoned. Rādhā, whatever is suffering, there your desire should be abandoned.” (The fourth repetition.)
