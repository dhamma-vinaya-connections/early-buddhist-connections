## SN 35.183 The Discourse on the Simile of the Six Animals

247. ‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, puriso arugatto pakkagatto saravanaṃ paviseyya. Tassa kusakaṇṭakā ceva pāde vijjheyyuṃ, sarapattāni ca gattāni [sarapattāni pakkagattāni (syā. kaṃ.), arupakkāni gattāni (pī. ka.)] vilekheyyuṃ. Evañhi so, bhikkhave, puriso bhiyyosomattāya tatonidānaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvediyetha. Evameva kho, bhikkhave, idhekacco bhikkhu gāmagato vā araññagato vā labhati vattāraṃ – ‘ayañca so [ayañca kho (pī. ka.), ayaṃ so (?)] āyasmā evaṃkārī evaṃsamācāro asucigāmakaṇṭako’ti. Taṃ kaṇṭakoti [taṃ ‘‘asucigāmakaṇḍato’’ti (ka.)] iti viditvā saṃvaro ca asaṃvaro ca veditabbo.

247."Monks, suppose a man with a body covered with sores, with festering limbs, were to enter a thorn thicket. The thorn-pricks would pierce his feet, and the thorn-leaves would scrape his limbs. That man, monks, would experience even more pain and distress because of that. In the same way, monks, a certain monk who has gone to a village or the wilderness finds someone who speaks of him thus: ‘This venerable one acts in such a way, behaves in such a manner—he is an impure village-thorn.’ Knowing him to be a thorn, one should understand both restraint and lack of restraint."

‘‘Kathañca, bhikkhave, asaṃvaro hoti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu cakkhunā rūpaṃ disvā piyarūpe rūpe adhimuccati, appiyarūpe rūpe byāpajjati, anupaṭṭhitakāyassati ca viharati parittacetaso. Tañca cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti, yatthassa te uppannā pāpakā akusalā dhammā aparisesā nirujjhanti. Sotena saddaṃ sutvā… ghānena gandhaṃ ghāyitvā… jivhāya rasaṃ sāyitvā… kāyena phoṭṭhabbaṃ phusitvā… manasā dhammaṃ viññāya piyarūpe dhamme adhimuccati, appiyarūpe dhamme byāpajjati, anupaṭṭhitakāyassati ca viharati parittacetaso, tañca cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti, yatthassa te uppannā pāpakā akusalā dhammā aparisesā nirujjhanti.

"And how, monks, is there lack of restraint? Here, monks, a monk, seeing a form with the eye, is infatuated with pleasing forms and averse to displeasing forms. He dwells with mindfulness of the body unestablished, with a limited mind. And he does not understand as it actually is the liberation of mind and the liberation by wisdom, where those arisen evil, unwholesome qualities cease without remainder. Hearing a sound with the ear, he is infatuated with pleasing sounds and averse to displeasing sounds. He dwells with mindfulness of the body unestablished, with a limited mind. And he does not understand as it actually is the liberation of mind and the liberation by wisdom, where those arisen evil, unwholesome qualities cease without remainder. Smelling an odor with the nose, he is infatuated with pleasing odors and averse to displeasing odors. He dwells with mindfulness of the body unestablished, with a limited mind. And he does not understand as it actually is the liberation of mind and the liberation by wisdom, where those arisen evil, unwholesome qualities cease without remainder. Tasting a flavor with the tongue, he is infatuated with pleasing flavors and averse to displeasing flavors. He dwells with mindfulness of the body unestablished, with a limited mind. And he does not understand as it actually is the liberation of mind and the liberation by wisdom, where those arisen evil, unwholesome qualities cease without remainder. Touching a tangible with the body, he is infatuated with pleasing tangibles and averse to displeasing tangibles. He dwells with mindfulness of the body unestablished, with a limited mind. And he does not understand as it actually is the liberation of mind and the liberation by wisdom, where those arisen evil, unwholesome qualities cease without remainder. Cognizing a mental phenomenon with the mind, he is infatuated with pleasing mental phenomena and averse to displeasing mental phenomena. He dwells with mindfulness of the body unestablished, with a limited mind. And he does not understand as it actually is the liberation of mind and the liberation by wisdom, where those arisen evil, unwholesome qualities cease without remainder."

"Monks, suppose a man were to catch six animals—each with different ranges and different pastures—and tie them with a strong rope. He would catch a snake and tie it with a strong rope. He would catch a crocodile and tie it with a strong rope. He would catch a bird and tie it with a strong rope. He would catch a dog and tie it with a strong rope. He would catch a jackal and tie it with a strong rope. He would catch a monkey and tie it with a strong rope. Having tied them with a strong rope, he would make a knot in the middle and release them. Then, monks, those six animals—each with different ranges and different pastures—would each pull toward its own range and pasture: the snake would pull, thinking, ‘I will enter an anthill’; the crocodile would pull, thinking, ‘I will enter the water’; the bird would pull, thinking, ‘I will fly into the sky’; the dog would pull, thinking, ‘I will enter the village’; the jackal would pull, thinking, ‘I will enter the charnel ground’; the monkey would pull, thinking, ‘I will enter the forest.’ When, monks, those six animals become tired and exhausted, they would submit to whichever among them is the strongest; they would follow along and come under its control. In the same way, monks, for any monk whose mindfulness of the body is undeveloped and uncultivated: the eye pulls toward pleasing forms, and unpleasing forms are repulsive; the ear pulls toward pleasing sounds, and unpleasing sounds are repulsive; the nose pulls toward pleasing odors, and unpleasing odors are repulsive; the tongue pulls toward pleasing flavors, and unpleasing flavors are repulsive; the body pulls toward pleasing tangibles, and unpleasing tangibles are repulsive; the mind pulls toward pleasing mental phenomena, and unpleasing mental phenomena are repulsive. Thus, monks, one is unrestrained."

"And how, monks, is there restraint? Here, monks, a monk, seeing a form with the eye, is not infatuated with pleasing forms and is not averse to displeasing forms. He dwells with mindfulness of the body established, with an immeasurable mind.

"Monks, suppose a man were to catch six animals—each with different ranges and different pastures—and tie them firmly with a strong rope. He would catch a snake and tie it firmly with a strong rope. He would catch a crocodile and tie it firmly with a strong rope. He would catch a bird and tie it firmly with a strong rope. He would catch a dog and tie it firmly with a strong rope. He would catch a jackal and tie it firmly with a strong rope. He would catch a monkey and tie it firmly with a strong rope. Having tied them firmly, he would fasten them to a strong post or pillar. Then, monks, those six animals—each with different ranges and different pastures—would each pull toward their own domain: the snake would pull, thinking, ‘I will enter an anthill’; the crocodile would pull, thinking, ‘I will enter the water’; the bird would pull, thinking, ‘I will fly into the sky’; the dog would pull, thinking, ‘I will enter the village’; the jackal would pull, thinking, ‘I will enter the charnel ground’; the monkey would pull, thinking, ‘I will enter the forest.’ But when, monks, those six animals become tired and exhausted, they would stand, sit, or lie down right there by that post or pillar. In the same way, monks, for any monk who has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body: the eye does not pull toward pleasing forms, nor are unpleasing forms repulsive; the ear does not pull toward pleasing sounds, nor are unpleasing sounds repulsive; the nose does not pull toward pleasing odors, nor are unpleasing odors repulsive; the tongue does not pull toward pleasing flavors, nor are unpleasing flavors repulsive; the body does not pull toward pleasing tangibles, nor are unpleasing tangibles repulsive; the mind does not pull toward pleasing mental phenomena, nor are unpleasing mental phenomena repulsive. Thus, monks, there is restraint."

‘‘‘Daḷhe khīle vā thambhe vā’ti kho, bhikkhave, kāyagatāya satiyā etaṃ adhivacanaṃ. Tasmātiha vo, bhikkhave, evaṃ sikkhitabbaṃ – ‘kāyagatā no sati bhāvitā bhavissati bahulīkatā yānīkatā vatthukatā anuṭṭhitā paricitā susamāraddhā’ti. Evañhi kho, bhikkhave, sikkhitabba’’nti. Dasamaṃ.

"‘A strong post or pillar,’ monks, is a designation for mindfulness of the body. Therefore, monks, you should train yourselves thus: ‘Mindfulness of the body will be developed, cultivated, made a vehicle, made a basis, established, consolidated, and properly undertaken.’ Thus, monks, should you train yourselves." The tenth.
