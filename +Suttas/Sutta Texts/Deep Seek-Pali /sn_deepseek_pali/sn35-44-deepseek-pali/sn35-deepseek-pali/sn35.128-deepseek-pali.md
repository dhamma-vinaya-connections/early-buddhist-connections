## SN 35.128 The Discourse on Impermanence Conducive to Nibbāna

147. ‘‘Nibbānasappāyaṃ vo, bhikkhave, paṭipadaṃ desessāmi. Taṃ suṇātha…pe… katamā ca sā, bhikkhave, nibbānasappāyā paṭipadā? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu cakkhuṃ aniccanti passati, rūpā aniccāti passati, cakkhuviññāṇaṃ aniccanti passati, cakkhusamphasso aniccoti passati. Yampidaṃ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi aniccanti passati…pe… jivhā aniccāti passati, rasā aniccāti passati, jivhāviññāṇaṃ aniccanti passati, jivhāsamphasso aniccoti passati, yampidaṃ jivhāsamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi aniccanti passati…pe… mano aniccoti passati, dhammā aniccāti passati, manoviññāṇaṃ aniccanti passati, manosamphasso aniccoti passati, yampidaṃ manosamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi aniccanti passati. Ayaṃ kho sā, bhikkhave, nibbānasappāyā paṭipadā’’ti. Dutiyaṃ.

147."Bhikkhus, I will teach you the practice conducive to Nibbāna. Listen to it... And what, bhikkhus, is that practice conducive to Nibbāna? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu sees the eye as impermanent, forms as impermanent, eye-consciousness as impermanent, eye-contact as impermanent. Whatever feeling arises conditioned by eye-contact—pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too he sees as impermanent. He sees the ear as impermanent, sounds as impermanent, ear-consciousness as impermanent, ear-contact as impermanent. Whatever feeling arises conditioned by ear-contact—pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too he sees as impermanent. He sees the nose as impermanent, odours as impermanent, nose-consciousness as impermanent, nose-contact as impermanent. Whatever feeling arises conditioned by nose-contact—pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too he sees as impermanent. He sees the tongue as impermanent, tastes as impermanent, tongue-consciousness as impermanent, tongue-contact as impermanent. Whatever feeling arises conditioned by tongue-contact—pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too he sees as impermanent. He sees the body as impermanent, tactile objects as impermanent, body-consciousness as impermanent, body-contact as impermanent. Whatever feeling arises conditioned by body-contact—pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too he sees as impermanent. He sees the mind as impermanent, mental objects as impermanent, mind-consciousness as impermanent, mind-contact as impermanent. Whatever feeling arises conditioned by mind-contact—pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too he sees as impermanent. This, bhikkhus, is that practice conducive to Nibbāna."
