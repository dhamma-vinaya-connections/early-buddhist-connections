# SN 35.73 Paṭhamadvayasuttaṃ

## SN 35.73 The First Discourse on Duality

92. ‘‘Dvayaṃ vo, bhikkhave, desessāmi. Taṃ suṇātha. Kiñca, bhikkhave, dvayaṃ? Cakkhuñceva rūpā ca, sotañceva saddā ca, ghānañceva gandhā ca, jivhā ceva rasā ca, kāyo ceva phoṭṭhabbā ca, mano ceva dhammā ca – idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, dvayaṃ.

92.“Bhikkhus, I shall teach you the duality. Listen to that. And what, bhikkhus, is that duality? The eye and forms, the ear and sounds, the nose and smells, the tongue and tastes, the body and tangibles, the mind and mental phenomena—this, bhikkhus, is called the duality.

‘‘Yo, bhikkhave, evaṃ vadeyya – ‘ahametaṃ dvayaṃ paccakkhāya aññaṃ dvayaṃ paññapessāmī’ti, tassa vācāvatthukamevassa. Puṭṭho ca na sampāyeyya. Uttariñca vighātaṃ āpajjeyya. Taṃ kissa hetu? Yathā taṃ, bhikkhave, avisayasmi’’nti. Navamaṃ.

If anyone, bhikkhus, should say: ‘Having rejected this duality, I shall make known another duality,’ that would be merely a verbal statement for him. And when questioned, he would not be able to hold his own, and further, he would meet with vexation. For what reason? Because, bhikkhus, that is not within his domain.” The ninth.
