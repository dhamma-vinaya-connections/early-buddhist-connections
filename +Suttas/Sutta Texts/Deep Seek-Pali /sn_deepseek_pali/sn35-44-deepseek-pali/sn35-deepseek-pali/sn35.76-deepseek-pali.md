## SN 35.76 The Discourse to Mālukyaputta

95. Atha kho āyasmā mālukyaputto [māluṅkyaputto (sī.)] yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami…pe… ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā mālukyaputto bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘sādhu me, bhante, bhagavā saṃkhittena dhammaṃ desetu, yamahaṃ bhagavato dhammaṃ sutvā eko vūpakaṭṭho appamatto ātāpī pahitatto vihareyya’’nti.

95.Then the Venerable Mālukyaputta approached the Blessed One…and said to him: “Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute.”

‘‘Ettha dāni, mālukyaputta, kiṃ dahare bhikkhū vakkhāma! Yatra hi nāma tvaṃ, bhikkhu, jiṇṇo vuddho mahallako addhagato vayoanuppatto saṃkhittena ovādaṃ yācasī’’ti.

“Now, Mālukyaputta, what shall we say to the young bhikkhus? For you, bhikkhu, are old, aged, burdened with years, having reached the final stage of life, yet you ask for brief instruction.”

‘‘Kiñcāpāhaṃ, bhante, jiṇṇo vuddho mahallako addhagato vayoanuppatto. Desetu me, bhante, bhagavā saṃkhittena dhammaṃ, desetu sugato saṃkhittena dhammaṃ, appeva nāmāhaṃ bhagavato bhāsitassa atthaṃ ājāneyyaṃ. Appeva nāmāhaṃ bhagavato bhāsitassa dāyādo assa’’nti.

“Even though I am, venerable sir, old, aged, burdened with years, having reached the final stage of life, let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in brief, let the Well-Gone One teach me the Dhamma in brief. Perhaps I might understand the meaning of the Blessed One’s words. Perhaps I might be an heir to the Blessed One’s teaching.”

‘‘Taṃ kiṃ maññasi, mālukyaputta, ye te cakkhuviññeyyā rūpā adiṭṭhā adiṭṭhapubbā, na ca passasi, na ca te hoti passeyyanti? Atthi te tattha chando vā rāgo vā pemaṃ vā’’ti? ‘‘No hetaṃ, bhante’’.

“What do you think, Mālukyaputta? As to those forms cognizable by the eye—unseen, never seen before, and which you do not see and will not see—do you have any desire, lust, or affection for them?” “No, venerable sir.”

‘‘Ye te sotaviññeyyā saddā assutā assutapubbā, na ca suṇāsi, na ca te hoti suṇeyyanti? Atthi te tattha chando vā rāgo vā pemaṃ vā’’ti? ‘‘No hetaṃ, bhante’’.

“As to those sounds cognizable by the ear—unheard, never heard before, and which you do not hear and will not hear—do you have any desire, lust, or affection for them?” “No, venerable sir.”

‘‘Ye te ghānaviññeyyā gandhā aghāyitā aghāyitapubbā, na ca ghāyasi, na ca te hoti ghāyeyyanti? Atthi te tattha chando vā rāgo vā pemaṃ vā’’ti? ‘‘No hetaṃ, bhante’’.

“As to those odors cognizable by the nose—unsmelled, never smelled before, and which you do not smell and will not smell—do you have any desire, lust, or affection for them?” “No, venerable sir.”

‘‘Ye te jivhāviññeyyā rasā asāyitā asāyitapubbā, na ca sāyasi, na ca te hoti sāyeyyanti? Atthi te tattha chando vā rāgo vā pemaṃ vā’’ti? ‘‘No hetaṃ, bhante’’.

“As to those flavors cognizable by the tongue—untasted, never tasted before, and which you do not taste and will not taste—do you have any desire, lust, or affection for them?” “No, venerable sir.”

‘‘Ye te kāyaviññeyyā phoṭṭhabbā asamphuṭṭhā asamphuṭṭhapubbā, na ca phusasi, na ca te hoti phuseyyanti? Atthi te tattha chando vā rāgo vā pemaṃ vā’’ti? ‘‘No hetaṃ, bhante’’.

“As to those tangibles cognizable by the body—untouched, never touched before, and which you do not touch and will not touch—do you have any desire, lust, or affection for them?” “No, venerable sir.”

‘‘Ye te manoviññeyyā dhammā aviññātā aviññātapubbā, na ca vijānāsi, na ca te hoti vijāneyyanti? Atthi te tattha chando vā rāgo vā pemaṃ vā’’ti? ‘‘No hetaṃ, bhante’’.

“As to those mental phenomena cognizable by the mind—uncognized, never cognized before, and which you do not cognize and will not cognize—do you have any desire, lust, or affection for them?” “No, venerable sir.”

‘‘Ettha ca te, mālukyaputta, diṭṭhasutamutaviññātabbesu dhammesu diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṃ bhavissati, sute sutamattaṃ bhavissati, mute mutamattaṃ bhavissati, viññāte viññātamattaṃ bhavissati. Yato kho te, mālukyaputta, diṭṭhasutamutaviññātabbesu dhammesu diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṃ bhavissati, sute sutamattaṃ bhavissati, mute mutamattaṃ bhavissati, viññāte viññātamattaṃ bhavissati; tato tvaṃ, mālukyaputta, na tena. Yato tvaṃ, mālukyaputta, na tena; tato tvaṃ, mālukyaputta, na tattha. Yato tvaṃ, mālukyaputta, na tattha; tato tvaṃ, mālukyaputta, nevidha, na huraṃ, na ubhayamantarena. Esevanto dukkhassā’’ti.

“Here, Mālukyaputta, with regard to things seen, heard, sensed, and cognized: in the seen there will be merely the seen; in the heard merely the heard; in the sensed merely the sensed; in the cognized merely the cognized. When, Mālukyaputta, for you, with regard to things seen, heard, sensed, and cognized, in the seen there is merely the seen, in the heard merely the heard, in the sensed merely the sensed, in the cognized merely the cognized, then, Mālukyaputta, you will not be ‘by that.’ When you are not ‘by that,’ then you will not be ‘in that.’ When you are not ‘in that,’ then you will be neither here nor beyond nor in between the two. This itself is the end of suffering.”

‘‘Imassa khvāhaṃ, bhante, bhagavatā saṃkhittena bhāsitassa vitthārena atthaṃ ājānāmi –

“Venerable sir, I understand the detailed meaning of what the Blessed One has stated in brief as follows:

Atha kho āyasmā mālukyaputto bhagavato bhāsitaṃ abhinanditvā anumoditvā uṭṭhāyāsanā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṃ katvā pakkāmi.

Then the Venerable Mālukyaputta, having rejoiced in and approved of the Blessed One’s words, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed. Then, dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute, the Venerable Mālukyaputta, not long after, by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge, entered and dwelled in that unsurpassed culmination of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness. He directly knew: “Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.” And the Venerable Mālukyaputta became one of the Arahants. The Second.
