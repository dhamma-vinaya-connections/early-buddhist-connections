25. "Monks, I will teach you the Dhamma for the full knowing, complete understanding, and abandoning of all. Listen carefully. And what, monks, is the Dhamma for the full knowing, complete understanding, and abandoning of all? The eye, monks, is to be fully known, completely understood, and abandoned. Forms are to be fully known, completely understood, and abandoned. Eye-consciousness is to be fully known, completely understood, and abandoned. Eye-contact is to be fully known, completely understood, and abandoned. Whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is to be fully known, completely understood, and abandoned. …pe… The tongue is to be fully known, completely understood, and abandoned. Tastes are to be fully known, completely understood, and abandoned. Tongue-consciousness is to be fully known, completely understood, and abandoned. Tongue-contact is to be fully known, completely understood, and abandoned. Whatever feeling arises with tongue-contact as condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is to be fully known, completely understood, and abandoned. The body is to be fully known, completely understood, and abandoned. … The mind is to be fully known, completely understood, and abandoned. Mental objects are to be fully known, completely understood, and abandoned. Mind-consciousness is to be fully known, completely understood, and abandoned. Mind-contact is to be fully known, completely understood, and abandoned. Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is to be fully known, completely understood, and abandoned. This, monks, is the Dhamma for the full knowing, complete understanding, and abandoning of all." The third.
