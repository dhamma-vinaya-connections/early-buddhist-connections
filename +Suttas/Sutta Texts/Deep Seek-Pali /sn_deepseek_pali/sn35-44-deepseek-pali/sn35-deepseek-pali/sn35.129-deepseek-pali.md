148."Bhikkhus, I will teach you the practice conducive to Nibbāna. Listen to it... And what, bhikkhus, is that practice conducive to Nibbāna? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu sees the eye as suffering, forms as suffering, eye-consciousness as suffering, eye-contact as suffering. Whatever feeling arises conditioned by eye-contact—pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too he sees as suffering. He sees the ear as suffering, sounds as suffering, ear-consciousness as suffering, ear-contact as suffering. Whatever feeling arises conditioned by ear-contact—pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too he sees as suffering. He sees the nose as suffering, odours as suffering, nose-consciousness as suffering, nose-contact as suffering. Whatever feeling arises conditioned by nose-contact—pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too he sees as suffering. He sees the tongue as suffering, tastes as suffering, tongue-consciousness as suffering, tongue-contact as suffering. Whatever feeling arises conditioned by tongue-contact—pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too he sees as suffering. He sees the body as suffering, tactile objects as suffering, body-consciousness as suffering, body-contact as suffering. Whatever feeling arises conditioned by body-contact—pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too he sees as suffering. He sees the mind as suffering, mental objects as suffering, mind-consciousness as suffering, mind-contact as suffering. Whatever feeling arises conditioned by mind-contact—pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too he sees as suffering. This, bhikkhus, is that practice conducive to Nibbāna." Third.
