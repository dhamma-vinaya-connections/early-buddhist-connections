30.“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the practice suitable for uprooting all conceivings. Listen to that, attend carefully, and I will speak.” “And what, bhikkhus, is that practice suitable for uprooting all conceivings? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not conceive the eye, does not conceive in the eye, does not conceive from the eye, does not conceive, ‘The eye is mine.’ He does not conceive forms, does not conceive in forms, does not conceive from forms, does not conceive, ‘Forms are mine.’ He does not conceive eye-consciousness, does not conceive in eye-consciousness, does not conceive from eye-consciousness, does not conceive, ‘Eye-consciousness is mine.’ He does not conceive eye-contact, does not conceive in eye-contact, does not conceive from eye-contact, does not conceive, ‘Eye-contact is mine.’ He does not conceive whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—does not conceive in it, does not conceive from it, does not conceive, ‘That is mine.’ … He does not conceive the tongue, does not conceive in the tongue, does not conceive from the tongue, does not conceive, ‘The tongue is mine.’ He does not conceive tastes, does not conceive in tastes, does not conceive from tastes, does not conceive, ‘Tastes are mine.’ He does not conceive tongue-consciousness, does not conceive in tongue-consciousness, does not conceive from tongue-consciousness, does not conceive, ‘Tongue-consciousness is mine.’ He does not conceive tongue-contact, does not conceive in tongue-contact, does not conceive from tongue-contact, does not conceive, ‘Tongue-contact is mine.’ He does not conceive whatever feeling arises with tongue-contact as condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—does not conceive in it, does not conceive from it, does not conceive, ‘That is mine.’ … He does not conceive the mind, does not conceive in the mind, does not conceive from the mind, does not conceive, ‘The mind is mine.’ He does not conceive mental phenomena, does not conceive in mental phenomena, does not conceive from mental phenomena, does not conceive, ‘Mental phenomena are mine.’ He does not conceive mind-consciousness, does not conceive in mind-consciousness, does not conceive from mind-consciousness, does not conceive, ‘Mind-consciousness is mine.’ He does not conceive mind-contact, does not conceive in mind-contact, does not conceive from mind-contact, does not conceive, ‘Mind-contact is mine.’ He does not conceive whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—does not conceive in it, does not conceive from it, does not conceive, ‘That is mine.’ He does not conceive all, does not conceive in all, does not conceive from all, does not conceive, ‘All is mine.’ Not conceiving thus, he does not cling to anything in the world. Not clinging, he is not agitated. Being unagitated, he personally attains Nibbāna. He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’ This, bhikkhus, is that practice suitable for uprooting all conceivings.” Eighth.
