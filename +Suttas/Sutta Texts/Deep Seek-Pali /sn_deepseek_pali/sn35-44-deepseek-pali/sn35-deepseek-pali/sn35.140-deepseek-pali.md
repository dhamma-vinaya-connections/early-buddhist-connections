## SN 35.140 The Discourse on External Impermanence and the Destruction of Delight

159. ‘‘Rūpe, bhikkhave, yoniso manasi karotha; rūpāniccatañca yathābhūtaṃ samanupassatha. Rūpe, bhikkhave, bhikkhu yoniso manasikaronto, rūpāniccatañca yathābhūtaṃ samanupassanto rūpesupi nibbindati. Nandikkhayā rāgakkhayo; rāgakkhayā nandikkhayo. Nandirāgakkhayā cittaṃ suvimuttanti vuccati. Sadde… gandhe… rase… phoṭṭhabbe… dhamme, bhikkhave, yoniso manasi karotha; dhammāniccatañca yathābhūtaṃ samanupassatha. Dhamme, bhikkhave, bhikkhu yoniso manasikaronto, dhammāniccatañca yathābhūtaṃ samanupassanto dhammesupi nibbindati. Nandikkhayā rāgakkhayo; rāgakkhayā nandikkhayo. Nandirāgakkhayā cittaṃ suvimuttanti vuccatī’’ti. Catutthaṃ.

159.“Bhikkhus, attend carefully to form; discern its impermanence as it really is. A bhikkhu, bhikkhus, who attends carefully to form and discerns its impermanence as it really is, becomes disenchanted with form. With the destruction of delight, lust is destroyed; with the destruction of lust, delight is destroyed. With the destruction of delight and lust, the mind is said to be well liberated. Bhikkhus, attend carefully to sounds… odors… tastes… tactile objects… mental phenomena; discern their impermanence as it really is. A bhikkhu, bhikkhus, who attends carefully to mental phenomena and discerns their impermanence as it really is, becomes disenchanted with mental phenomena. With the destruction of delight, lust is destroyed; with the destruction of lust, delight is destroyed. With the destruction of delight and lust, the mind is said to be well liberated.” The fourth.
