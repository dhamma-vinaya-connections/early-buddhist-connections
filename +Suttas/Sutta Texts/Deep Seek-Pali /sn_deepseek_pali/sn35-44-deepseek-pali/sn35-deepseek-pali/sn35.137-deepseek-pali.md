## SN 35.137 The Discourse on the Internal Destruction of Delight

156. ‘‘Aniccaṃyeva, bhikkhave, bhikkhu cakkhuṃ aniccanti passati, sāssa [sāyaṃ (pī. ka.)] hoti sammādiṭṭhi. Sammā passaṃ nibbindati. Nandikkhayā rāgakkhayo; rāgakkhayā nandikkhayo. Nandirāgakkhayā cittaṃ suvimuttanti vuccati…pe… aniccaṃyeva, bhikkhave, bhikkhu jivhaṃ aniccanti passati, sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi. Sammā passaṃ nibbindati. Nandikkhayā rāgakkhayo; rāgakkhayā…pe… cittaṃ suvimuttanti vuccati…pe… aniccaṃyeva, bhikkhave, bhikkhu manaṃ aniccanti passati, sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi. Sammā passaṃ nibbindati. Nandikkhayā rāgakkhayo; rāgakkhayā nandikkhayo. Nandirāgakkhayā cittaṃ suvimuttanti vuccatī’’ti. Paṭhamaṃ.

156.“Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu sees the eye as impermanent, that is his right view. Seeing rightly, he becomes disenchanted. With the destruction of delight, there is the destruction of passion; with the destruction of passion, there is the destruction of delight. With the destruction of delight and passion, the mind is said to be well liberated.
…When a bhikkhu sees the tongue as impermanent, that is his right view. Seeing rightly, he becomes disenchanted. With the destruction of delight, there is the destruction of passion; with the destruction of passion, there is the destruction of delight. With the destruction of delight and passion, the mind is said to be well liberated.
