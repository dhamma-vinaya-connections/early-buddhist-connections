## SN 35.164 The First Discourse on the Ocean

228. ‘‘‘Samuddo, samuddo’ti, bhikkhave, assutavā puthujjano bhāsati. Neso, bhikkhave, ariyassa vinaye samuddo. Mahā eso, bhikkhave, udakarāsi mahāudakaṇṇavo. Cakkhu, bhikkhave, purisassa samuddo; tassa rūpamayo vego.

228.“Monks, the uninstructed ordinary person speaks of ‘the ocean, the ocean.’ But in the Noble One’s Discipline, that is not called the ocean. Monks, that is a great mass of water, a great watery expanse. The eye, monks, is a person’s ocean; its current consists of forms. One who withstands that current of forms is said, monks, to have crossed the ocean of the eye with its waves, whirlpools, sharks, and demons; having crossed over, gone beyond, the brahmin stands on high ground. [...] The tongue, monks, is a person’s ocean; its current consists of tastes. One who withstands that current of tastes is said, monks, to have crossed the ocean of the tongue with its waves, whirlpools, sharks, and demons; having crossed over, gone beyond, the brahmin stands on high ground. [...] The mind, monks, is a person’s ocean; its current consists of mental phenomena. One who withstands that current of mental phenomena is said, monks, to have crossed the ocean of the mind with its waves, whirlpools, sharks, and demons; having crossed over, gone beyond, the brahmin stands on high ground.” This the Blessed One said.

‘‘Yo imaṃ samuddaṃ sagāhaṃ sarakkhasaṃ,Saūmiṃ sāvaṭṭaṃ sabhayaṃ duttaraṃ accatari;Sa vedagū vusitabrahmacariyo,Lokantagū pāragatoti vuccatī’’ti. paṭhamaṃ;

“He who has crossed this ocean with its sharks and demons, with its waves, whirlpools, and dangers, so hard to cross; he is a knower of the Vedas, one who has lived the holy life, one who has reached the end of the world; he is called ‘gone beyond.’” This is the first.
