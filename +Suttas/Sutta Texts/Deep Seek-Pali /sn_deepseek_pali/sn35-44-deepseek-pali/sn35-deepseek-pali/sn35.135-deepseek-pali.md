# SN 35.135 Indriyasampannasuttaṃ

## SN 35.135 The Discourse on One Endowed with Faculties

154. Atha kho aññataro bhikkhu yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami…pe… ekamantaṃ nisinno kho so bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘‘indriyasampanno, indriyasampanno’ti, bhante, vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, indriyasampanno hotī’’ti?

154.Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One… and, on arrival, having bowed to the Blessed One, he sat down to one side. Seated to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, it is said, ‘one endowed with faculties, one endowed with faculties.’ To what extent, venerable sir, is one endowed with faculties?”

‘‘Cakkhundriye ce, bhikkhu, udayabbayānupassī viharanto cakkhundriye nibbindati…pe… jivhindriye ce, bhikkhu, udayabbayānupassī viharanto jivhindriye nibbindati…pe… manindriye ce, bhikkhu, udayabbayānupassī viharanto manindriye nibbindati. Nibbindaṃ virajjati…pe… vimuttasmiṃ vimuttamiti ñāṇaṃ hoti. ‘Khīṇā jāti, vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ, kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ, nāparaṃ itthattāyā’ti pajānāti. Ettāvatā kho, bhikkhu, indriyasampanno hotī’’ti. Navamaṃ.

“Here, bhikkhu, dwelling contemplating rise and fall in the eye faculty, one becomes disenchanted with the eye faculty; dwelling contemplating rise and fall in the ear faculty, one becomes disenchanted with the ear faculty; dwelling contemplating rise and fall in the nose faculty, one becomes disenchanted with the nose faculty; dwelling contemplating rise and fall in the tongue faculty, one becomes disenchanted with the tongue faculty; dwelling contemplating rise and fall in the body faculty, one becomes disenchanted with the body faculty; dwelling contemplating rise and fall in the mind faculty, one becomes disenchanted with the mind faculty. Being disenchanted, one becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, one is liberated. When liberated, there is the knowledge: ‘Liberated.’ One understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’ To this extent, bhikkhu, one is endowed with faculties.” This is the ninth.
