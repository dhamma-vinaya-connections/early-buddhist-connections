## SN 36.16 The Second Discourse about Ānanda

264. Atha kho āyasmā ānando yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘katamā nu kho, ānanda, vedanā, katamo vedanāsamudayo, katamo vedanānirodho, katamā vedanānirodhagāminī paṭipadā? Ko vedanāya assādo, ko ādīnavo, kiṃ nissaraṇa’’nti? ‘‘Bhagavaṃmūlakā no, bhante, dhammā bhagavannettikā bhagavampaṭisaraṇā. Sādhu, bhante, bhagavantaññeva paṭibhātu etassa bhāsitassa attho. Bhagavato sutvā bhikkhū dhāressantī’’ti. ‘‘Tena hi, ānanda, suṇohi, sādhukaṃ manasi karohi; bhāsissāmī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti kho āyasmā ānando bhagavato paccassosi. Bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘tisso imā, ānanda, vedanā – sukhā vedanā, dukkhā vedanā, adukkhamasukhā vedanā – imā vuccanti, ānanda, vedanā…pe… phassasamudayā…pe… khīṇāsavassa bhikkhuno rāgo paṭippassaddho hoti, doso paṭippassaddho hoti, moho paṭippassaddho hotī’’ti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

264.Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. As the Venerable Ānanda was sitting to one side, the Blessed One said to him: "What, Ānanda, is feeling? What is the origin of feeling? What is the cessation of feeling? What is the path leading to the cessation of feeling? What is the gratification in feeling? What is the danger? What is the escape?" "Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, and have the Blessed One as their refuge. It would be good if the Blessed One would explain the meaning of this utterance. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the monks will remember it." "Then listen, Ānanda, and attend closely; I will speak." "Yes, venerable sir," the Venerable Ānanda replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this: "There are, Ānanda, these three feelings: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. These are called feelings. With the arising of contact there is the arising of feeling; with the cessation of contact there is the cessation of feeling. This Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of feeling, that is: right view...right concentration. The pleasure and gladness that arise dependent on feeling: this is the gratification in feeling. That feeling is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change: this is the danger in feeling. The subduing of desire and lust, the abandoning of desire and lust for feeling: this is the escape from feeling. For a monk whose taints are destroyed, lust is allayed, hatred is allayed, delusion is allayed." The sixth.
