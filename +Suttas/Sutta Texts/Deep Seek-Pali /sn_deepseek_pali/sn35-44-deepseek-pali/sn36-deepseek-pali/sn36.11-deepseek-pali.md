## SN 36.11 The Solitary Sutta

259. Atha kho aññataro bhikkhu yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho so bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘idha mayhaṃ, bhante, rahogatassa paṭisallīnassa evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘tisso vedanā vuttā bhagavatā. Sukhā vedanā, dukkhā vedanā, adukkhamasukhā vedanā – imā tisso vedanā vuttā bhagavatā. Vuttaṃ kho panetaṃ bhagavatā – ‘yaṃ kiñci vedayitaṃ taṃ dukkhasmi’nti. Kiṃ nu kho etaṃ bhagavatā sandhāya bhāsitaṃ – ‘yaṃ kiñci vedayitaṃ taṃ dukkhasmi’’’nti?

259.Then a certain monk approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, that monk said to the Blessed One: “Here, venerable sir, as I was alone in seclusion, this thought arose in my mind: ‘The Blessed One has spoken of three feelings: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither pleasant nor painful feeling. These three feelings have been spoken of by the Blessed One. Yet this has also been said by the Blessed One: “Whatever is felt is suffering.” With reference to what, venerable sir, was this said by the Blessed One: “Whatever is felt is suffering”?’ ”

‘‘Sādhu sādhu, bhikkhu! Tisso imā, bhikkhu, vedanā vuttā mayā. Sukhā vedanā, dukkhā vedanā, adukkhamasukhā vedanā – imā tisso vedanā vuttā mayā. Vuttaṃ kho panetaṃ, bhikkhu, mayā – ‘yaṃ kiñci vedayitaṃ, taṃ dukkhasmi’nti. Taṃ kho panetaṃ, bhikkhu, mayā saṅkhārānaṃyeva aniccataṃ sandhāya bhāsitaṃ – ‘yaṃ kiñci vedayitaṃ taṃ dukkhasmi’nti. Taṃ kho panetaṃ, bhikkhu, mayā saṅkhārānaṃyeva khayadhammataṃ…pe… vayadhammataṃ…pe… virāgadhammataṃ …pe… nirodhadhammataṃ…pe… vipariṇāmadhammataṃ sandhāya bhāsitaṃ – ‘yaṃ kiñci vedayitaṃ taṃ dukkhasmi’nti. Atha kho pana, bhikkhu, mayā anupubbasaṅkhārānaṃ nirodho akkhāto. Paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ samāpannassa vācā niruddhā hoti. Dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ samāpannassa vitakkavicārā niruddhā honti.

“Good, good, monk! These three feelings, monk, have been spoken of by me: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither pleasant nor painful feeling. These three feelings have been spoken of by me. Yet this has also been said by me, monk: ‘Whatever is felt is suffering.’ That, monk, was said by me with reference to the impermanence of formations: ‘Whatever is felt is suffering.’ That, monk, was said by me with reference to the nature of formations to be subject to destruction, subject to vanishing, subject to fading away, subject to cessation, and subject to change: ‘Whatever is felt is suffering.’ And further, monk, I have explained the gradual cessation of formations. For one who has attained the first jhāna, speech is ceased. For one who has attained the second jhāna, initial application and sustained application are ceased. For one who has attained the third jhāna, rapture is ceased. For one who has attained the fourth jhāna, in-breathing and out-breathing are ceased. For one who has attained the base of infinite space, the perception of form is ceased. For one who has attained the base of infinite consciousness, the perception of the base of infinite space is ceased. For one who has attained the base of nothingness, the perception of the base of infinite consciousness is ceased. For one who has attained the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, the perception of the base of nothingness is ceased. For one who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling are ceased. For a monk whose taints are destroyed, lust is ceased, hatred is ceased, delusion is ceased. And further, monk, I have explained the gradual subsiding of formations. For one who has attained the first jhāna, speech is subsided. For one who has attained the second jhāna, initial application and sustained application are subsided. For one who has attained the third jhāna, rapture is subsided. For one who has attained the fourth jhāna, in-breathing and out-breathing are subsided. For one who has attained the base of infinite space, the perception of form is subsided. For one who has attained the base of infinite consciousness, the perception of the base of infinite space is subsided. For one who has attained the base of nothingness, the perception of the base of infinite consciousness is subsided. For one who has attained the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, the perception of the base of nothingness is subsided. For one who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling are subsided. For a monk whose taints are destroyed, lust is subsided, hatred is subsided, delusion is subsided. There are these six kinds of tranquility, monk. For one who has attained the first jhāna, speech is stilled. For one who has attained the second jhāna, initial application and sustained application are stilled. For one who has attained the third jhāna, rapture is stilled. For one who has attained the fourth jhāna, in-breathing and out-breathing are stilled. For one who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling are stilled. For a monk whose taints are destroyed, lust is stilled, hatred is stilled, delusion is stilled.” The First.
