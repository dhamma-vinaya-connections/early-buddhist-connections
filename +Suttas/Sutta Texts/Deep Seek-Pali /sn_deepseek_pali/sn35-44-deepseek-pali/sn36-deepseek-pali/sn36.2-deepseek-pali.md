## SN 36.2 The Discourse on Pleasant Feeling

250. ‘‘Tisso imā, bhikkhave, vedanā. Katamā tisso? Sukhā vedanā, dukkhā vedanā, adukkhamasukhā vedanā – imā kho, bhikkhave, tisso vedanāti.

250."Monks, there are these three feelings. Which three? Pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. These, monks, are the three feelings."

‘‘Sukhaṃ vā yadi vā dukkhaṃ, adukkhamasukhaṃ saha;Ajjhattañca bahiddhā ca, yaṃ kiñci atthi veditaṃ.

"Whether pleasant or painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant together, whatever is felt, internally or externally,"

‘‘Etaṃ dukkhanti ñatvāna, mosadhammaṃ palokinaṃ;Phussa phussa vayaṃ passaṃ, evaṃ tattha virajjatī’’ti. dutiyaṃ;

"having known this as suffering, as deceptive, as perishable, seeing its dissolution again and again, one becomes dispassionate towards it." Second.
