## SN 37.32 The Discourse on the Occasions

311. ‘‘Pañcimāni, bhikkhave, ṭhānāni dullabhāni akatapuññena mātugāmena. Katamāni pañca? Patirūpe kule jāyeyyanti – idaṃ, bhikkhave, paṭhamaṃ ṭhānaṃ dullabhaṃ akatapuññena mātugāmena. Patirūpe kule jāyitvā patirūpaṃ kulaṃ gaccheyyanti – idaṃ, bhikkhave, dutiyaṃ ṭhānaṃ dullabhaṃ akatapuññena mātugāmena. Patirūpe kule jāyitvā, patirūpaṃ kulaṃ gantvā, asapatti agāraṃ ajjhāvaseyyanti – idaṃ, bhikkhave, tatiyaṃ ṭhānaṃ dullabhaṃ akatapuññena mātugāmena. Patirūpe kule jāyitvā, patirūpaṃ kulaṃ gantvā, asapatti agāraṃ ajjhāvasantī puttavatī assanti – idaṃ, bhikkhave, catutthaṃ ṭhānaṃ dullabhaṃ akatapuññena mātugāmena. Patirūpe kule jāyitvā, patirūpaṃ kulaṃ gantvā, asapatti agāraṃ ajjhāvasantī puttavatī samānā sāmikaṃ abhibhuyya vatteyyanti – idaṃ, bhikkhave, pañcamaṃ ṭhānaṃ dullabhaṃ akatapuññena mātugāmena. Imāni kho, bhikkhave, pañca ṭhānāni dullabhāni akatapuññena mātugāmenāti.

311.“Bhikkhus, there are these five occasions difficult for a woman who has not performed merit to obtain. What five? That she be born into a suitable family—this, bhikkhus, is the first occasion difficult for a woman who has not performed merit to obtain. That, having been born into a suitable family, she go to a suitable family—this, bhikkhus, is the second occasion difficult for a woman who has not performed merit to obtain. That, having been born into a suitable family and gone to a suitable family, she dwell in a household without a co-wife—this, bhikkhus, is the third occasion difficult for a woman who has not performed merit to obtain. That, having been born into a suitable family, gone to a suitable family, and dwelling in a household without a co-wife, she have children—this, bhikkhus, is the fourth occasion difficult for a woman who has not performed merit to obtain. That, having been born into a suitable family, gone to a suitable family, dwelling in a household without a co-wife, and having children, she prevail over her husband—this, bhikkhus, is the fifth occasion difficult for a woman who has not performed merit to obtain. These, bhikkhus, are the five occasions difficult for a woman who has not performed merit to obtain.”

‘‘Pañcimāni, bhikkhave, ṭhānāni sulabhāni katapuññena mātugāmena. Katamāni pañca? Patirūpe kule jāyeyyanti – idaṃ, bhikkhave, paṭhamaṃ ṭhānaṃ sulabhaṃ katapuññena mātugāmena. Patirūpe kule jāyitvā patirūpaṃ kulaṃ gaccheyyanti – idaṃ, bhikkhave, dutiyaṃ ṭhānaṃ sulabhaṃ katapuññena mātugāmena. Patirūpe kule jāyitvā patirūpaṃ kulaṃ gantvā asapatti agāraṃ ajjhāvaseyyanti – idaṃ, bhikkhave, tatiyaṃ ṭhānaṃ sulabhaṃ katapuññena mātugāmena. Patirūpe kule jāyitvā patirūpaṃ kulaṃ gantvā asapatti agāraṃ ajjhāvasantī puttavatī assanti – idaṃ, bhikkhave, catutthaṃ ṭhānaṃ sulabhaṃ katapuññena mātugāmena. Patirūpe kule jāyitvā patirūpaṃ kulaṃ gantvā asapatti agāraṃ ajjhāvasantī puttavatī samānā sāmikaṃ abhibhuyya vatteyyanti – idaṃ, bhikkhave, pañcamaṃ ṭhānaṃ sulabhaṃ katapuññena mātugāmena. Imāni kho, bhikkhave, pañca ṭhānāni sulabhāni katapuññena mātugāmenā’’ti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

“Bhikkhus, there are these five occasions easily obtained by a woman who has performed merit. What five? That she be born into a suitable family—this, bhikkhus, is the first occasion easily obtained by a woman who has performed merit. That, having been born into a suitable family, she go to a suitable family—this, bhikkhus, is the second occasion easily obtained by a woman who has performed merit. That, having been born into a suitable family and gone to a suitable family, she dwell in a household without a co-wife—this, bhikkhus, is the third occasion easily obtained by a woman who has performed merit. That, having been born into a suitable family, gone to a suitable family, and dwelling in a household without a co-wife, she have children—this, bhikkhus, is the fourth occasion easily obtained by a woman who has performed merit. That, having been born into a suitable family, gone to a suitable family, dwelling in a household without a co-wife, and having children, she prevail over her husband—this, bhikkhus, is the fifth occasion easily obtained by a woman who has performed merit. These, bhikkhus, are the five occasions easily obtained by a woman who has performed merit.” This is the eighth.
