309. ‘‘Pañcimāni, bhikkhave, mātugāmassa balāni. Katamāni pañca? Rūpabalaṃ, bhogabalaṃ, ñātibalaṃ, puttabalaṃ, sīlabalaṃ. Rūpabalena ca, bhikkhave, mātugāmo samannāgato hoti, na ca sīlabalena, nāsenteva naṃ, kule na vāsenti.

309.“Bhikkhus, there are these five powers of a woman. What five? The power of beauty, the power of wealth, the power of relatives, the power of children, and the power of virtue. When a woman, bhikkhus, is endowed with the power of beauty but not with the power of virtue, they reject her, they do not allow her to live in the family. When a woman, bhikkhus, is endowed with the power of beauty and the power of wealth but not with the power of virtue, they reject her, they do not allow her to live in the family.
