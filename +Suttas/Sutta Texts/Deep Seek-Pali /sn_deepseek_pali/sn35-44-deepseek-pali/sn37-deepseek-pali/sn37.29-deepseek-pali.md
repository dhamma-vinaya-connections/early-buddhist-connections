## SN 37.29 The Discourse on the Factors

308. ‘‘Pañcimāni, bhikkhave, mātugāmassa balāni. Katamāni pañca? Rūpabalaṃ, bhogabalaṃ, ñātibalaṃ, puttabalaṃ, sīlabalaṃ. Rūpabalena ca, bhikkhave, mātugāmo samannāgato hoti, na ca bhogabalena – evaṃ so tenaṅgena aparipūro hoti. Yato ca kho, bhikkhave, mātugāmo rūpabalena ca samannāgato hoti, bhogabalena ca – evaṃ so tenaṅgena paripūro hoti. Rūpabalena ca, bhikkhave, mātugāmo samannāgato hoti, bhogabalena ca, na ca ñātibalena – evaṃ so tenaṅgena aparipūro hoti. Yato ca kho, bhikkhave, mātugāmo rūpabalena ca samannāgato hoti, bhogabalena ca, ñātibalena ca – evaṃ so tenaṅgena paripūro hoti. Rūpabalena ca, bhikkhave, mātugāmo samannāgato hoti, bhogabalena ca, ñātibalena ca, na ca puttabalena – evaṃ so tenaṅgena aparipūro hoti. Yato ca kho, bhikkhave, mātugāmo rūpabalena ca samannāgato hoti, bhogabalena ca, ñātibalena ca, puttabalena ca – evaṃ so tenaṅgena paripūro hoti. Rūpabalena ca, bhikkhave, mātugāmo samannāgato hoti, bhogabalena ca, ñātibalena ca, puttabalena ca, na ca sīlabalena – evaṃ so tenaṅgena aparipūro hoti. Yato ca kho, bhikkhave, mātugāmo rūpabalena ca samannāgato hoti, bhogabalena ca, ñātibalena ca, puttabalena ca, sīlabalena ca – evaṃ so tenaṅgena paripūro hoti. Imāni kho, bhikkhave, pañca mātugāmassa balānī’’ti. Pañcamaṃ.

308."Bhikkhus, there are these five powers of a woman. Which five? The power of beauty, the power of wealth, the power of relatives, the power of children, and the power of virtue. When a woman, bhikkhus, is endowed with the power of beauty but not with the power of wealth, thus she is incomplete in that factor. But when a woman, bhikkhus, is endowed with both the power of beauty and the power of wealth, thus she is complete in that factor. When a woman, bhikkhus, is endowed with the power of beauty and the power of wealth but not with the power of relatives, thus she is incomplete in that factor. But when a woman, bhikkhus, is endowed with the power of beauty, the power of wealth, and the power of relatives, thus she is complete in that factor. When a woman, bhikkhus, is endowed with the power of beauty, the power of wealth, and the power of relatives but not with the power of children, thus she is incomplete in that factor. But when a woman, bhikkhus, is endowed with the power of beauty, the power of wealth, the power of relatives, and the power of children, thus she is complete in that factor. When a woman, bhikkhus, is endowed with the power of beauty, the power of wealth, the power of relatives, and the power of children but not with the power of virtue, thus she is incomplete in that factor. But when a woman, bhikkhus, is endowed with the power of beauty, the power of wealth, the power of relatives, the power of children, and the power of virtue, thus she is complete in that factor. These, bhikkhus, are the five powers of a woman." Fifth.
