# SN 45.53 Kalyāṇamittasuttaṃ

## SN 45.53 The Discourse on Good Friendship.

84. ‘‘Nāhaṃ, bhikkhave, aññaṃ ekadhammampi samanupassāmi, yena anuppanno vā ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo uppajjati, uppanno vā ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo bhāvanāpāripūriṃ gacchati, yathayidaṃ, bhikkhave, kalyāṇamittatā. Kalyāṇamittassetaṃ, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno pāṭikaṅkhaṃ – ariyaṃ aṭṭhaṅgikaṃ maggaṃ bhāvessati, ariyaṃ aṭṭhaṅgikaṃ maggaṃ bahulīkarissati. Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kalyāṇamitto ariyaṃ aṭṭhaṅgikaṃ maggaṃ bhāveti, ariyaṃ aṭṭhaṅgikaṃ maggaṃ bahulīkaroti? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sammādiṭṭhiṃ bhāveti rāgavinayapariyosānaṃ dosavinayapariyosānaṃ mohavinayapariyosānaṃ…pe… sammāsamādhiṃ bhāveti rāgavinayapariyosānaṃ dosavinayapariyosānaṃ mohavinayapariyosānaṃ. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kalyāṇamitto ariyaṃ aṭṭhaṅgikaṃ maggaṃ bhāveti, ariyaṃ aṭṭhaṅgikaṃ maggaṃ bahulīkarotī’’ti. Paṭhamaṃ.

84."Monks, I do not envision any other single factor by which the unarisen Noble Eightfold Path arises, or the arisen Noble Eightfold Path reaches fulfillment through development, as much as this, monks: good friendship. For a monk who has good friends, monks, this is to be expected: he will develop the Noble Eightfold Path, he will cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path. And how, monks, does a monk who has good friends develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path? Here, monks, a monk develops right view, culminating in the removal of lust, the removal of hatred, and the removal of delusion...he develops right concentration, culminating in the removal of lust, the removal of hatred, and the removal of delusion. It is in this way, monks, that a monk who has good friends develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path." First.

"Monks, I do not envision any other single factor by which the unarisen Noble Eightfold Path arises, or the arisen Noble Eightfold Path reaches fulfillment through development, as much as this, monks: the accomplishment of virtue...as much as this, monks: the accomplishment of zeal...as much as this, monks: the accomplishment of self...as much as this, monks: the accomplishment of view...as much as this, monks: the accomplishment of heedfulness...
