# SN 45.85 Nīghasuttaṃ

## SN 45.85 The Oppressions Discourse.

168. ‘‘Tayome, bhikkhave, nīghā. Katame tayo? Rāgo nīgho, doso nīgho, moho nīgho – ime kho, bhikkhave, tayo nīghā. Imesaṃ kho, bhikkhave, tiṇṇannaṃ nīghānaṃ abhiññāya pariññāya parikkhayāya pahānāya…pe… ayaṃ ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo bhāvetabbo’’ti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

168."Monks, there are these three oppressions. What three? Lust is an oppression, hate is an oppression, delusion is an oppression. These, monks, are the three oppressions. For the direct knowledge, full understanding, utter destruction, and abandonment of these three oppressions… this Noble Eightfold Path is to be cultivated." The Eighth.
