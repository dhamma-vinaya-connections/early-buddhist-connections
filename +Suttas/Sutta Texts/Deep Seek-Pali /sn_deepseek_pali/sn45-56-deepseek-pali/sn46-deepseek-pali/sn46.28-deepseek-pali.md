# SN 46.28 Nibbedhabhāgiyasuttaṃ

## SN 46.28 The Discourse on the Factors Leading to Penetration

209. ‘‘Nibbedhabhāgiyaṃ vo, bhikkhave, maggaṃ desessāmi; taṃ suṇātha. Katamo ca, bhikkhave, nibbedhabhāgiyo maggo? Yadidaṃ – satta bojjhaṅgā. Katame satta? Satisambojjhaṅgo…pe… upekkhāsambojjhaṅgo’’ti. Evaṃ vutte āyasmā udāyī bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘kathaṃ bhāvitā nu kho, bhante, satta bojjhaṅgā kathaṃ bahulīkatā nibbedhāya saṃvattantī’’ti?

209."Monks, I will teach you the path that conduces to penetration; listen to it. And what, monks, is the path that conduces to penetration? It is these seven factors of enlightenment. What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness… (similarly for the other factors up to)… the enlightenment factor of equanimity." When this was said, Venerable Udāyi said to the Blessed One: "But how, venerable sir, when developed, how, when cultivated, do these seven factors of enlightenment conduce to penetration?"

‘‘Idha, udāyi, bhikkhu satisambojjhaṅgaṃ bhāveti vivekanissitaṃ virāganissitaṃ nirodhanissitaṃ vossaggapariṇāmiṃ vipulaṃ mahaggataṃ appamāṇaṃ abyāpajjaṃ. So satisambojjhaṅgaṃ bhāvitena cittena anibbiddhapubbaṃ appadālitapubbaṃ lobhakkhandhaṃ nibbijjhati padāleti; anibbiddhapubbaṃ appadālitapubbaṃ dosakkhandhaṃ nibbijjhati padāleti; anibbiddhapubbaṃ appadālitapubbaṃ mohakkhandhaṃ nibbijjhati padāleti…pe… upekkhāsambojjhaṅgaṃ bhāveti vivekanissitaṃ virāganissitaṃ nirodhanissitaṃ vossaggapariṇāmiṃ vipulaṃ mahaggataṃ appamāṇaṃ abyāpajjaṃ. So upekkhāsambojjhaṅgaṃ bhāvitena cittena anibbiddhapubbaṃ appadālitapubbaṃ lobhakkhandhaṃ nibbijjhati padāleti; anibbiddhapubbaṃ appadālitapubbaṃ dosakkhandhaṃ nibbijjhati padāleti; anibbiddhapubbaṃ appadālitapubbaṃ mohakkhandhaṃ nibbijjhati padāleti. Evaṃ bhāvitā kho, udāyi, satta bojjhaṅgā evaṃ bahulīkatā nibbedhāya saṃvattantī’’ti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

"Here, Udāyī, a monk develops the mindfulness enlightenment factor, which is based on seclusion, based on dispassion, based on cessation, and culminates in relinquishment, is expansive, great, immeasurable, and free from ill will. With a mind developed in the mindfulness enlightenment factor, he penetrates and shatters the mass of greed that he had never penetrated or shattered before; he penetrates and shatters the mass of hatred that he had never penetrated or shattered before; he penetrates and shatters the mass of delusion that he had never penetrated or shattered before… (similarly for the other enlightenment factors up to)… he develops the equanimity enlightenment factor, which is based on seclusion, based on dispassion, based on cessation, and culminates in relinquishment, is expansive, great, immeasurable, and free from ill will. With a mind developed in the equanimity enlightenment factor, he penetrates and shatters the mass of greed that he had never penetrated or shattered before; he penetrates and shatters the mass of hatred that he had never penetrated or shattered before; he penetrates and shatters the mass of delusion that he had never penetrated or shattered before. Thus, Udāyī, these seven enlightenment factors, when developed and cultivated in this way, lead to penetration." The eighth.
