# SN 51.30 Dutiyabhikkhusuttaṃ

## SN 51.30 The Second Bhikkhu Sutta

842. Atha kho sambahulā bhikkhū yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu…pe… ekamantaṃ nisinne kho te bhikkhū bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘katamā nu kho, bhikkhave, iddhi, katamo iddhipādo, katamā iddhipādabhāvanā, katamā iddhipādabhāvanāgāminī paṭipadā’’ti? Bhagavaṃmūlakā no, bhante, dhammā bhagavaṃnettikā…pe….

842.Then many bhikkhus approached the Blessed One… Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. When they had sat down to one side, the Blessed One said to them: “Bhikkhus, what is supernormal power? What is the basis for supernormal power? What is the development of the bases for supernormal power? What is the practice leading to the development of the bases for supernormal power?” “Bhante, our teachings have the Blessed One as their root, the Blessed One as their guide….”

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, iddhi? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu anekavihitaṃ iddhividhaṃ paccanubhoti – ekopi hutvā bahudhā hoti…pe… yāva brahmalokāpi kāyena vasaṃ vatteti – ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, iddhi.

“And what, bhikkhus, is supernormal power? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu experiences various kinds of supernormal power: being one, he becomes many… he wields bodily mastery even as far as the Brahmā world—this, bhikkhus, is called supernormal power.”

‘‘Katamo ca, bhikkhave, iddhipādo? Yo, bhikkhave, maggo, yā paṭipadā iddhilābhāya iddhipaṭilābhāya saṃvattati – ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, iddhipādo.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the basis for supernormal power? Whatever path and practice lead to the acquisition of supernormal power—this, bhikkhus, is called the basis for supernormal power.”

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, iddhipādabhāvanā? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu chandasamādhippadhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṃ iddhipādaṃ bhāveti, vīriyasamādhi…pe… cittasamādhi…pe… vīmaṃsāsamādhippadhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṃ iddhipādaṃ bhāveti – ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, iddhipādabhāvanā.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the development of the bases for supernormal power? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis for supernormal power possessed of concentration due to desire and the volitional formations of striving. He develops the basis for supernormal power possessed of concentration due to energy and the volitional formations of striving. He develops the basis for supernormal power possessed of concentration due to mind and the volitional formations of striving. He develops the basis for supernormal power possessed of concentration due to investigation and the volitional formations of striving. This, bhikkhus, is called the development of the bases for supernormal power.”

‘‘Katamā ca, bhikkhave, iddhipādabhāvanāgāminī paṭipadā? Ayameva ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo, seyyathidaṃ – sammādiṭṭhi…pe… sammāsamādhi. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, iddhipādabhāvanāgāminī paṭipadā’’ti. Dasamaṃ.

“And what, bhikkhus, is the practice leading to the development of the bases for supernormal power? It is just this Noble Eightfold Path, namely: right view… right concentration. This, bhikkhus, is called the practice leading to the development of the bases for supernormal power.” Tenth.
