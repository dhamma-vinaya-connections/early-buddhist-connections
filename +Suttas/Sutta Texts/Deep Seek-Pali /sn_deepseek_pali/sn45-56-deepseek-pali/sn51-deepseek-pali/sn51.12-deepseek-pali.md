# SN 51.12 Mahapphalasuttaṃ

## SN 51.12 The Discourse on Great Fruit

824. ‘‘Cattārome, bhikkhave, iddhipādā bhāvitā bahulīkatā mahapphalā honti mahānisaṃsā. Kathaṃ bhāvitā ca, bhikkhave, cattāro iddhipādā kathaṃ bahulīkatā mahapphalā honti mahānisaṃsā? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu chandasamādhippadhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṃ iddhipādaṃ bhāveti – ‘iti me chando na ca atilīno bhavissati, na ca atippaggahito bhavissati, na ca ajjhattaṃ saṃkhitto bhavissati, na ca bahiddhā vikkhitto bhavissati’. Pacchāpuresaññī ca viharati – yathā pure tathā pacchā, yathā pacchā tathā pure; yathā adho tathā uddhaṃ, yathā uddhaṃ tathā adho; yathā divā tathā rattiṃ, yathā rattiṃ tathā divā. Iti vivaṭena cetasā apariyonaddhena sappabhāsaṃ cittaṃ bhāveti.

824."Monks, these four bases of psychic power, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and great benefit. And how, monks, when developed and cultivated, are the four bases of psychic power of great fruit and great benefit? Here, monks, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic power that possesses concentration due to desire accompanied by volitional formations of exertion, thinking: ‘Thus my desire will be neither too slack nor too strained, neither inwardly constricted nor outwardly scattered.’ And he dwells perceiving light—as it is before, so it is after; as it is after, so it is before; as it is below, so it is above; as it is above, so it is below; as it is by day, so it is by night; as it is by night, so it is by day. Thus, with an open and unconfined mind, he develops a mind imbued with light.

‘‘Vīriyasamādhi…pe… cittasamādhi…pe… vīmaṃsāsamādhippadhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṃ iddhipādaṃ bhāveti – ‘iti me vīmaṃsā na ca atilīnā bhavissati, na ca atippaggahitā bhavissati, na ca ajjhattaṃ saṃkhittā bhavissati, na ca bahiddhā vikkhittā bhavissati’. Pacchāpuresaññī ca viharati – yathā pure tathā pacchā, yathā pacchā tathā pure; yathā adho tathā uddhaṃ, yathā uddhaṃ tathā adho; yathā divā tathā rattiṃ, yathā rattiṃ tathā divā. Iti vivaṭena cetasā apariyonaddhena sappabhāsaṃ cittaṃ bhāveti. Evaṃ bhāvitā kho, bhikkhave, cattāro iddhipādā evaṃ bahulīkatā mahapphalā honti mahānisaṃsā.

"He develops the basis of psychic power that possesses concentration due to energy… concentration due to mind… concentration due to investigation, accompanied by volitional formations of exertion, thinking: ‘Thus my investigation will be neither too slack nor too strained, neither inwardly constricted nor outwardly scattered.’ And he dwells perceiving light—as it is before, so it is after; as it is after, so it is before; as it is below, so it is above; as it is above, so it is below; as it is by day, so it is by night; as it is by night, so it is by day. Thus, with an open and unconfined mind, he develops a mind imbued with light. Monks, when these four bases of psychic power are developed and cultivated in this way, they are of great fruit and great benefit."

‘‘Evaṃ bhāvitesu kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu catūsu iddhipādesu evaṃ bahulīkatesu anekavihitaṃ iddhividhaṃ paccanubhoti – ekopi hutvā bahudhā hoti…pe… yāva brahmalokāpi kāyena vasaṃ vatteti…pe….

"Monks, when these four bases of psychic power are thus developed and cultivated, a bhikkhu experiences various kinds of psychic power: having been one, he becomes many... he wields bodily mastery even as far as the Brahma world...

‘‘Evaṃ bhāvitesu kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu catūsu iddhipādesu evaṃ bahulīkatesu, āsavānaṃ khayā anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharatī’’ti. Dutiyaṃ.

"Monks, when these four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, a monk, with the destruction of the taints, realizes for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells therein." This is the second.
