## SN 51.31 The Moggallāna Sutta

843. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘taṃ kiṃ maññatha, bhikkhave, katamesaṃ dhammānaṃ bhāvitattā bahulīkatattā moggallāno bhikkhu evaṃmahiddhiko evaṃmahānubhāvo’’ti? Bhagavaṃmūlakā no, bhante, dhammā bhagavaṃnettikā…pe… ‘‘catunnaṃ kho, bhikkhave, iddhipādānaṃ bhāvitattā bahulīkatattā moggallāno bhikkhu evaṃmahiddhiko evaṃmahānubhāvo’’.

843.There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Monks, what do you think: by developing and cultivating which qualities is the bhikkhu Moggallāna of such great power and might?” “Our teachings, Bhante, are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One…” “Monks, it is by developing and cultivating the four bases of psychic power that the bhikkhu Moggallāna is of such great power and might.”

‘‘Katamesaṃ catunnaṃ? Idha, bhikkhave, moggallāno bhikkhu chandasamādhippadhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṃ iddhipādaṃ bhāveti – ‘iti me chando na ca atilīno bhavissati, na ca atippaggahito bhavissati, na ca ajjhattaṃ saṃkhitto bhavissati, na ca bahiddhā vikkhitto bhavissati’. Pacchāpuresaññī ca viharati – ‘yathā pure tathā pacchā, yathā pacchā tathā pure; yathā adho tathā uddhaṃ, yathā uddhaṃ tathā adho; yathā divā tathā rattiṃ, yathā rattiṃ tathā divā’. Iti vivaṭena cetasā apariyonaddhena sappabhāsaṃ cittaṃ bhāveti. Vīriyasamādhi…pe… cittasamādhi…pe… vīmaṃsāsamādhippadhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṃ iddhipādaṃ bhāveti – ‘iti me vīmaṃsā na ca atilīnā bhavissati, na ca atippaggahitā bhavissati, na ca ajjhattaṃ saṃkhittā bhavissati, na ca bahiddhā vikkhittā bhavissati’…pe… iti vivaṭena cetasā apariyonaddhena sappabhāsaṃ cittaṃ bhāveti. Imesaṃ kho, bhikkhave, catunnaṃ iddhipādānaṃ bhāvitattā bahulīkatattā moggallāno bhikkhu evaṃmahiddhiko evaṃmahānubhāvo.

“Which four? Here, monks, the bhikkhu Moggallāna develops the basis of psychic power that possesses concentration of desire accompanied by the volitional formations of striving, thinking: ‘Thus my desire will be neither too slack nor too tense, neither inwardly constricted nor outwardly scattered.’ He dwells perceiving the before and after: ‘As before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.’ Thus, with an open, unconfined mind, he develops a luminous mind. He develops the basis of psychic power that possesses concentration of energy accompanied by the volitional formations of striving, thinking: ‘Thus my energy will be neither too slack nor too tense, neither inwardly constricted nor outwardly scattered.’ He dwells perceiving the before and after: ‘As before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.’ Thus, with an open, unconfined mind, he develops a luminous mind. He develops the basis of psychic power that possesses concentration of mind accompanied by the volitional formations of striving, thinking: ‘Thus my mind will be neither too slack nor too tense, neither inwardly constricted nor outwardly scattered.’ He dwells perceiving the before and after: ‘As before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.’ Thus, with an open, unconfined mind, he develops a luminous mind. He develops the basis of psychic power that possesses concentration of investigation accompanied by the volitional formations of striving, thinking: ‘Thus my investigation will be neither too slack nor too tense, neither inwardly constricted nor outwardly scattered.’ He dwells perceiving the before and after: ‘As before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day.’ Thus, with an open, unconfined mind, he develops a luminous mind. It is by developing and cultivating these four bases of psychic power, monks, that the bhikkhu Moggallāna is of such great power and might.”

‘‘Imesañca pana, bhikkhave, catunnaṃ iddhipādānaṃ bhāvitattā bahulīkatattā moggalāno bhikkhu evaṃ anekavihitaṃ iddhividhaṃ paccanubhoti – ekopi hutvā bahudhā hoti, bahudhāpi hutvā eko hoti…pe… yāva brahmalokāpi kāyena vasaṃ vatteti. Imesañca pana, bhikkhave, catunnaṃ iddhipādānaṃ bhāvitattā bahulīkatattā moggallāno bhikkhu āsavānaṃ khayā anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharatī’’ti. Ekādasamaṃ.

“Moreover, monks, by developing and cultivating these four bases of psychic power, the bhikkhu Moggallāna experiences various kinds of psychic power: being one, he becomes many; being many, he becomes one… he wields bodily mastery as far as the Brahmā world. And moreover, monks, by developing and cultivating these four bases of psychic power, the bhikkhu Moggallāna, through the destruction of the taints, having realized it for himself with direct knowledge, enters and dwells in the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, in this very life.”
