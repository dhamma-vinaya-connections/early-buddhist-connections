## SN 55.7 The Discourse at Veḷudvāra

1003. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā kosalesu cārikaṃ caramāno mahatā bhikkhusaṅghena saddhiṃ yena veḷudvāraṃ nāma kosalānaṃ brāhmaṇagāmo tadavasari. Assosuṃ kho te veḷudvāreyyakā brāhmaṇagahapatikā – ‘‘samaṇo khalu, bho, gotamo sakyaputto sakyakulā pabbajito kosalesu cārikaṃ caramāno mahatā bhikkhusaṅghena saddhiṃ veḷudvāraṃ anuppatto. Taṃ kho pana bhavantaṃ gotamaṃ evaṃ kalyāṇo kittisaddo abbhuggato – ‘itipi so bhagavā arahaṃ sammāsambuddho vijjācaraṇasampanno sugato lokavidū anuttaro purisadammasārathi satthā devamanussānaṃ buddho bhagavā [bhagavāti (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)]. So imaṃ lokaṃ sadevakaṃ samārakaṃ sabrahmakaṃ sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiṃ pajaṃ sadevamanussaṃ sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedeti. So dhammaṃ deseti ādikalyāṇaṃ majjhekalyāṇaṃ pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ sātthaṃ sabyañjanaṃ, kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ parisuddhaṃ brahmacariyaṃ pakāseti’. Sādhu kho pana tathārūpānaṃ arahataṃ dassanaṃ hotī’’ti.

1003.Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was traveling in the Kosala country together with a large community of bhikkhus, and he arrived at a brahmin village of the Kosalans named Veḷudvāra. The brahmin householders of Veḷudvāra heard: “It seems that the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from the Sakyan clan, is traveling in the Kosala country together with a large community of bhikkhus, and he has arrived at Veḷudvāra. Now this good report about the Blessed Gotama had spread thus: ‘That Blessed One is an Arahant, a Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, perfect in knowledge and conduct, accomplished, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of those who can be trained, teacher of devas and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One.’ He makes known this world with its devas, Māras, and Brahmās, this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its devas and humans, having realized it for himself with direct knowledge. He teaches the Dhamma good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end, with the right meaning and wording, and he proclaims the holy life that is perfectly complete and pure.” It is good indeed to see such Arahants.”

Atha kho te veḷudvāreyyakā brāhmaṇagahapatikā yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu; upasaṅkamitvā appekacce bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu. Appekacce bhagavatā saddhiṃ sammodiṃsu; sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu. Appekacce yena bhagavā tenañjaliṃ paṇāmetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu. Appekacce bhagavato santike nāmagottaṃ sāvetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu. Appekacce tuṇhībhūtā ekamantaṃ nisīdiṃsu. Ekamantaṃ nisinnā kho te veḷudvāreyyakā brāhmaṇagahapatikā bhagavantaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘mayaṃ, bho gotama, evaṃkāmā evaṃchandā evaṃadhippāyā – puttasambādhasayanaṃ ajjhāvaseyyāma, kāsikacandanaṃ paccanubhaveyyāma, mālāgandhavilepanaṃ dhāreyyāma, jātarūparajataṃ sādiyeyyāma, kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjeyyāma. Tesaṃ no bhavaṃ gotamo amhākaṃ evaṃkāmānaṃ evaṃchandānaṃ evaṃadhippāyānaṃ tathā dhammaṃ desetu yathā mayaṃ puttasambādhasayanaṃ ajjhāvaseyyāma…pe… sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjeyyāmā’’ti.

Then the brahmin householders of Veḷudvāra approached the Blessed One. Having approached, some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side; some exchanged greetings with the Blessed One and, after exchanging courteous and amiable talk, sat down to one side; some extended their hands in reverential salutation toward the Blessed One and sat down to one side; some announced their name and clan in the presence of the Blessed One and sat down to one side; some sat down to one side in silence. Sitting to one side, the brahmin householders of Veḷudvāra said to the Blessed One: “Master Gotama, we have such desires, such wishes, such intentions—we wish to dwell in a house crowded with children, to enjoy Kāsi sandalwood, to wear garlands, perfumes, and ointments, to accept gold and silver, and after the breakup of the body, after death, to be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. Let Master Gotama teach us the Dhamma in such a way that we, who have such desires, such wishes, and such intentions, may dwell in a house crowded with children… and be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.”

‘‘Attūpanāyikaṃ vo, gahapatayo, dhammapariyāyaṃ desessāmi. Taṃ suṇātha, sādhukaṃ manasi karotha; bhāsissāmī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, bho’’ti kho te veḷudvāreyyakā brāhmaṇagahapatikā bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca –

“Householders, I will teach you a discourse on the Dhamma applicable to yourselves. Listen to it, attend carefully; I will speak.” “Yes, Master,” replied the brahmin householders of Veḷudvāra to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:

‘‘Katamo ca, gahapatayo, attupanāyiko dhammapariyāyo? Idha, gahapatayo, ariyasāvako iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘ahaṃ khosmi jīvitukāmo amaritukāmo sukhakāmo dukkhappaṭikūlo. Yo kho maṃ jīvitukāmaṃ amaritukāmaṃ sukhakāmaṃ dukkhappaṭikūlaṃ jīvitā voropeyya, na metaṃ assa piyaṃ manāpaṃ. Ahañceva kho pana paraṃ jīvitukāmaṃ amaritukāmaṃ sukhakāmaṃ dukkhappaṭikūlaṃ jīvitā voropeyyaṃ, parassapi taṃ assa appiyaṃ amanāpaṃ. Yo kho myāyaṃ dhammo appiyo amanāpo, parassa peso dhammo appiyo amanāpo. Yo kho myāyaṃ dhammo appiyo amanāpo, kathāhaṃ paraṃ tena saṃyojeyya’nti! So iti paṭisaṅkhāya attanā ca pāṇātipātā paṭivirato hoti, parañca pāṇātipātā veramaṇiyā samādapeti, pāṇātipātā veramaṇiyā ca vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati. Evamassāyaṃ kāyasamācāro tikoṭiparisuddho hoti.

“And what, householders, is the discourse on the Dhamma applicable to oneself? Here, householders, a noble disciple reflects thus: ‘I am one who desires to live, who does not desire to die, who desires happiness, and who is averse to pain. If someone were to deprive me of life, who desires to live, does not desire to die, desires happiness, and is averse to pain, that would not be pleasing or agreeable to me. And if I were to deprive another of life, who desires to live, does not desire to die, desires happiness, and is averse to pain, that would not be pleasing or agreeable to them. That which is unpleasing and disagreeable to me is also unpleasing and disagreeable to another. How could I inflict upon another that which is unpleasing and disagreeable to me?’ Reflecting thus, he himself abstains from the destruction of life, he encourages others to abstain from the destruction of life, and he speaks in praise of abstaining from the destruction of life. Thus his bodily conduct is purified in three ways.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, gahapatayo, ariyasāvako iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘yo kho me adinnaṃ theyyasaṅkhātaṃ ādiyeyya, na metaṃ assa piyaṃ manāpaṃ. Ahañceva kho pana parassa adinnaṃ theyyasaṅkhātaṃ ādiyeyyaṃ, parassapi taṃ assa appiyaṃ amanāpaṃ. Yo kho myāyaṃ dhammo appiyo amanāpo, parassa peso dhammo appiyo amanāpo. Yo kho myāyaṃ dhammo appiyo amanāpo, kathāhaṃ paraṃ tena saṃyojeyya’nti! So iti paṭisaṅkhāya attanā ca adinnādānā paṭivirato hoti, parañca adinnādānā veramaṇiyā samādapeti, adinnādānā veramaṇiyā ca vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati. Evamassāyaṃ kāyasamācāro tikoṭiparisuddho hoti.

“Furthermore, householders, a noble disciple reflects thus: ‘If someone were to take what is not given from me, which is reckoned as theft, that would not be pleasing or agreeable to me. And if I were to take what is not given from another, which is reckoned as theft, that would not be pleasing or agreeable to them. That which is unpleasing and disagreeable to me is also unpleasing and disagreeable to another. How could I inflict upon another that which is unpleasing and disagreeable to me?’ Reflecting thus, he himself abstains from taking what is not given, he encourages others to abstain from taking what is not given, and he speaks in praise of abstaining from taking what is not given. Thus his bodily conduct is purified in three ways.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, gahapatayo, ariyasāvako iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘yo kho me dāresu cārittaṃ āpajjeyya, na metaṃ assa piyaṃ manāpaṃ. Ahañceva kho pana parassa dāresu cārittaṃ āpajjeyyaṃ, parassapi taṃ assa appiyaṃ amanāpaṃ. Yo kho myāyaṃ dhammo appiyo amanāpo, parassa peso dhammo appiyo amanāpo. Yo kho myāyaṃ dhammo appiyo amanāpo, kathāhaṃ paraṃ tena saṃyojeyya’nti! So iti paṭisaṅkhāya attanā ca kāmesumicchācārā paṭivirato hoti, parañca kāmesumicchācārā veramaṇiyā samādapeti, kāmesumicchācārā veramaṇiyā ca vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati. Evamassāyaṃ kāyasamācāro tikoṭiparisuddho hoti.

“Furthermore, householders, a noble disciple reflects thus: ‘If someone were to engage in misconduct concerning my wives, that would not be pleasing or agreeable to me. And if I were to engage in misconduct concerning another’s wives, that would not be pleasing or agreeable to them. That which is unpleasing and disagreeable to me is also unpleasing and disagreeable to another. How could I inflict upon another that which is unpleasing and disagreeable to me?’ Reflecting thus, he himself abstains from misconduct in sensual pleasures, he encourages others to abstain from misconduct in sensual pleasures, and he speaks in praise of abstaining from misconduct in sensual pleasures. Thus his bodily conduct is purified in three ways.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, gahapatayo, ariyasāvako iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘yo kho me musāvādena atthaṃ bhañjeyya, na metaṃ assa piyaṃ manāpaṃ. Ahañceva kho pana parassa musāvādena atthaṃ bhañjeyyaṃ, parassapi taṃ assa appiyaṃ amanāpaṃ. Yo kho myāyaṃ dhammo appiyo amanāpo, parassa peso dhammo appiyo amanāpo. Yo kho myāyaṃ dhammo appiyo amanāpo, kathāhaṃ paraṃ tena saṃyojeyya’nti! So iti paṭisaṅkhāya attanā ca musāvādā paṭivirato hoti, parañca musāvādā veramaṇiyā samādapeti, musāvādā veramaṇiyā ca vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati. Evamassāyaṃ vacīsamācāro tikoṭiparisuddho hoti.

“Furthermore, householders, a noble disciple reflects thus: ‘If someone were to ruin my purpose by false speech, that would not be pleasing or agreeable to me. And if I were to ruin another’s purpose by false speech, that would not be pleasing or agreeable to them. That which is unpleasing and disagreeable to me is also unpleasing and disagreeable to another. How could I inflict upon another that which is unpleasing and disagreeable to me?’ Reflecting thus, he himself abstains from false speech, he encourages others to abstain from false speech, and he speaks in praise of abstaining from false speech. Thus his verbal conduct is purified in three ways.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, gahapatayo, ariyasāvako iti paṭisañcikkhati – yo kho maṃ pisuṇāya vācāya mitte bhindeyya [mittehi bhedeyya (syā. kaṃ. pī. ka.)], na metaṃ assa piyaṃ manāpaṃ. Ahañceva kho pana paraṃ pisuṇāya vācāya mitte bhindeyyaṃ, parassapi taṃ assa appiyaṃ amanāpaṃ…pe… evamassāyaṃ vacīsamācāro tikoṭiparisuddho hoti.

“Furthermore, householders, a noble disciple reflects thus: ‘If someone were to divide my friends with divisive speech, that would not be pleasing or agreeable to me. And if I were to divide another’s friends with divisive speech, that would not be pleasing or agreeable to them. That which is unpleasing and disagreeable to me is also unpleasing and disagreeable to another. How could I inflict upon another that which is unpleasing and disagreeable to me?’ Reflecting thus, he himself abstains from divisive speech, he encourages others to abstain from divisive speech, and he speaks in praise of abstaining from divisive speech. Thus his verbal conduct is purified in three ways.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, gahapatayo, ariyasāvako iti paṭisañcikkhati – yo kho maṃ pharusāya vācāya samudācareyya, na metaṃ assa piyaṃ manāpaṃ. Ahañceva kho pana paraṃ pharusāya vācāya samudācareyyaṃ, parassapi taṃ assa appiyaṃ amanāpaṃ. Yo kho myāyaṃ dhammo…pe… evamassāyaṃ vacīsamācāro tikoṭiparisuddho hoti.

“Furthermore, householders, a noble disciple reflects thus: ‘If someone were to address me with harsh speech, that would not be pleasing or agreeable to me. And if I were to address another with harsh speech, that would not be pleasing or agreeable to them. That which is unpleasing and disagreeable to me is also unpleasing and disagreeable to another. How could I inflict upon another that which is unpleasing and disagreeable to me?’ Reflecting thus, he himself abstains from harsh speech, he encourages others to abstain from harsh speech, and he speaks in praise of abstaining from harsh speech. Thus his verbal conduct is purified in three ways.

‘‘Puna caparaṃ, gahapatayo, ariyasāvako iti paṭisañcikkhati – ‘yo kho maṃ samphabhāsena samphappalāpabhāsena samudācareyya, na metaṃ assa piyaṃ manāpaṃ. Ahañceva kho pana paraṃ samphabhāsena samphappalāpabhāsena samudācareyyaṃ, parassapi taṃ assa appiyaṃ amanāpaṃ. Yo kho myāyaṃ dhammo appiyo amanāpo, parassa peso dhammo appiyo amanāpo. Yo kho myāyaṃ dhammo appiyo amanāpo, kathāhaṃ paraṃ tena saṃyojeyya’nti! So iti paṭisaṅkhāya attanā ca samphappalāpā paṭivirato hoti, parañca samphappalāpā veramaṇiyā samādapeti, samphappalāpā veramaṇiyā ca vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati. Evamassāyaṃ vacīsamācāro tikoṭiparisuddho hoti.

“Furthermore, householders, a noble disciple reflects thus: ‘If someone were to address me with idle chatter, that would not be pleasing or agreeable to me. And if I were to address another with idle chatter, that would not be pleasing or agreeable to them. That which is unpleasing and disagreeable to me is also unpleasing and disagreeable to another. How could I inflict upon another that which is unpleasing and disagreeable to me?’ Reflecting thus, he himself abstains from idle chatter, he encourages others to abstain from idle chatter, and he speaks in praise of abstaining from idle chatter. Thus his verbal conduct is purified in three ways.

‘‘So buddhe aveccappasādena samannāgato hoti – itipi so bhagavā…pe… satthā devamanussānaṃ buddho bhagavāti; dhamme …pe… saṅghe aveccappasādena samannāgato hoti suppaṭipanno bhagavato sāvakasaṅgho…pe… anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassāti. Ariyakantehi sīlehi samannāgato hoti akhaṇḍehi…pe… samādhisaṃvattanikehi. Yato kho, gahapatayo, ariyasāvako imehi sattahi saddhammehi [dhammehi (sī.)] samannāgato hoti imehi catūhi ākaṅkhiyehi ṭhānehi, so ākaṅkhamāno attanāva attānaṃ byākareyya – ‘khīṇanirayomhi khīṇatiracchānayoni [khīṇatiracchānayoniyo (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.), khīṇatiracchānayoniko (ka.)] khīṇapettivisayo khīṇāpāyaduggativinipāto, sotāpannohamasmi avinipātadhammo niyato sambodhiparāyaṇo’’’ti.

He is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Buddha—‘Indeed, the Blessed One is… teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One’; in the Dhamma… in the Saṅgha—he is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Bhikkhu Saṅgha of the Blessed One’s disciples, who have practiced well… the unsurpassed field of merit for the world. He is endowed with virtues dear to the noble ones—unbroken… conducive to concentration. When, householders, a noble disciple is endowed with these seven good qualities and these four assurances, he may declare of himself, if he wishes: ‘I am devoid of hell, devoid of the animal realm, devoid of the ghost realm, devoid of states of woe, bad destinations, and downfall. I am a stream-enterer, not subject to downfall, assured, destined for enlightenment.’

Evaṃ vutte veḷudvāreyyakā brāhmaṇagahapatikā bhagavantaṃ etadavocuṃ – ‘‘abhikkantaṃ, bho gotama…pe… ete mayaṃ bhavantaṃ gotamaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāma dhammañca bhikkhusaṅghañca. Upāsake no bhavaṃ gotamo dhāretu ajjatagge pāṇupete [pāṇupetaṃ (ka.)] saraṇaṃ gate’’ti. Sattamaṃ.

When this was said, the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate said this to the Blessed One: “Excellent, Master Gotama!… We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Bhikkhu Saṅgha. May Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge from this day forward, for as long as life lasts.” Seventh.
