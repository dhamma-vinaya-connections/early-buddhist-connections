# SN 48.38 Tatiyavibhaṅgasuttaṃ

## SN 48.38 The Third Analysis Discourse

508. ‘‘Pañcimāni, bhikkhave, indriyāni. Katamāni pañca? Sukhindriyaṃ, dukkhindriyaṃ, somanassindriyaṃ, domanassindriyaṃ, upekkhindriyaṃ.

508."Monks, there are these five faculties. What are the five? The faculty of pleasure, the faculty of pain, the faculty of gladness, the faculty of displeasure, and the faculty of equanimity."

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, sukhindriyaṃ? Yaṃ kho, bhikkhave, kāyikaṃ sukhaṃ, kāyikaṃ sātaṃ, kāyasamphassajaṃ sukhaṃ sātaṃ vedayitaṃ – idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, sukhindriyaṃ.

"And what, monks, is the faculty of pleasure? It is whatever, monks, is bodily pleasure, bodily ease, the pleasant, easeful feeling born of bodily contact—this is called, monks, the faculty of pleasure."

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, dukkhindriyaṃ? Yaṃ kho, bhikkhave, kāyikaṃ dukkhaṃ, kāyikaṃ asātaṃ, kāyasamphassajaṃ dukkhaṃ asātaṃ vedayitaṃ – idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, dukkhindriyaṃ.

"And what, monks, is the faculty of pain? Whatever, monks, is bodily pain, bodily unpleasantness, the painful, unpleasant feeling born of bodily contact—this, monks, is called the faculty of pain."

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, somanassindriyaṃ? Yaṃ kho, bhikkhave, cetasikaṃ sukhaṃ, cetasikaṃ sātaṃ, manosamphassajaṃ sukhaṃ sātaṃ vedayitaṃ – idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, somanassindriyaṃ.

"And what, monks, is the faculty of gladness? Whatever, monks, is mental pleasure, mental satisfaction, the pleasant and satisfying feeling born of mind-contact—this is called, monks, the faculty of gladness."

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, domanassindriyaṃ? Yaṃ kho, bhikkhave, cetasikaṃ dukkhaṃ, cetasikaṃ asātaṃ, manosamphassajaṃ dukkhaṃ asātaṃ vedayitaṃ – idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, domanassindriyaṃ.

"And what, monks, is the faculty of displeasure? Whatever, monks, is mental suffering, mental unpleasantness, the painful, unpleasant feeling born of mind-contact—this is called, monks, the faculty of displeasure."

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, upekkhindriyaṃ? Yaṃ kho, bhikkhave, kāyikaṃ vā cetasikaṃ vā neva sātaṃ nāsātaṃ vedayitaṃ – idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, upekkhindriyaṃ.

"And what, monks, is the faculty of equanimity? Whatever, monks, is feeling that is neither pleasant nor unpleasant, experienced physically or mentally—this is called, monks, the faculty of equanimity."

‘‘Tatra, bhikkhave, yañca sukhindriyaṃ yañca somanassindriyaṃ, sukhā sā vedanā daṭṭhabbā. Tatra, bhikkhave, yañca dukkhindriyaṃ yañca domanassindriyaṃ, dukkhā sā vedanā daṭṭhabbā. Tatra, bhikkhave, yadidaṃ upekkhindriyaṃ, adukkhamasukhā sā vedanā daṭṭhabbā. Iti kho, bhikkhave, imāni pañcindriyāni pañca hutvā tīṇi honti, tīṇi hutvā pañca honti pariyāyenā’’ti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

"Here, monks, the faculty of pleasure and the faculty of gladness should be seen as pleasant feeling. Here, monks, the faculty of pain and the faculty of displeasure should be seen as painful feeling. Here, monks, the faculty of equanimity should be seen as neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Thus, monks, these five faculties become three, and these three become five by way of arrangement." The eighth.
