## SN 48.67 The First Tree Discourse

537. ‘‘Seyyathāpi bhikkhave, ye keci jambudīpakā rukkhā, jambū tesaṃ aggamakkhāyati; evameva kho bhikkhave, ye keci bodhipakkhiyā dhammā, paññindriyaṃ tesaṃ aggamakkhāyati, yadidaṃ – bodhāya. Katame ca, bhikkhave, bodhipakkhiyā dhammā? Saddhindriyaṃ, bhikkhave, bodhipakkhiyo dhammo, taṃ bodhāya saṃvattati. Vīriyindriyaṃ…pe… satindriyaṃ…pe… samādhindriyaṃ…pe… paññindriyaṃ bodhipakkhiyo dhammo, taṃ bodhāya saṃvattati. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, ye keci jambudīpakā rukkhā, jambū tesaṃ aggamakkhāyati; evameva kho, bhikkhave, ye keci bodhipakkhiyā dhammā, paññindriyaṃ tesaṃ aggamakkhāyati, yadidaṃ – bodhāyā’’ti. Sattamaṃ.

537.“Monks, just as among whatever trees there are in Jambudīpa, the rose-apple is declared the foremost; so too, monks, among whatever qualities conducive to enlightenment there are, the faculty of wisdom is declared the foremost, that is, for enlightenment. And what, monks, are the qualities conducive to enlightenment? The faculty of faith, monks, is a quality conducive to enlightenment; it conduces to enlightenment. The faculty of energy…the faculty of mindfulness…the faculty of concentration…the faculty of wisdom is a quality conducive to enlightenment; it conduces to enlightenment. Just as, monks, among whatever trees there are in Jambudīpa, the rose-apple is declared the foremost; so too, monks, among whatever qualities conducive to enlightenment there are, the faculty of wisdom is declared the foremost, that is, for enlightenment.” The seventh.
