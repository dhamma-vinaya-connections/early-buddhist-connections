# SN 48.35 Dutiyasamaṇabrāhmaṇasuttaṃ

## SN 48.35 The Second Ascetics and Brahmins Sutta

505. ‘‘Pañcimāni, bhikkhave, indriyāni. Katamāni pañca? Sukhindriyaṃ, dukkhindriyaṃ, somanassindriyaṃ, domanassindriyaṃ, upekkhindriyaṃ. Ye hi keci, bhikkhave, samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā sukhindriyaṃ nappajānanti, sukhindriyasamudayaṃ nappajānanti, sukhindriyanirodhaṃ nappajānanti, sukhindriyanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ nappajānanti; dukkhindriyaṃ nappajānanti…pe… somanassindriyaṃ nappajānanti…pe… domanassindriyaṃ nappajānanti …pe… upekkhindriyaṃ nappajānanti, upekkhindriyasamudayaṃ nappajānanti, upekkhindriyanirodhaṃ nappajānanti, upekkhindriyanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ nappajānanti; na me te, bhikkhave, samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā samaṇesu vā samaṇasammatā brāhmaṇesu vā brāhmaṇasammatā, na ca panete āyasmanto sāmaññatthaṃ vā brahmaññatthaṃ vā diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharanti.

505.“Bhikkhus, there are these five faculties. What five? The faculty of pleasure, the faculty of pain, the faculty of joy, the faculty of sorrow, and the faculty of equanimity. Whatever ascetics or brahmins, bhikkhus, do not understand the faculty of pleasure, do not understand the origination of the faculty of pleasure, do not understand the cessation of the faculty of pleasure, do not understand the path leading to the cessation of the faculty of pleasure; who do not understand the faculty of pain… who do not understand the faculty of joy… who do not understand the faculty of sorrow… who do not understand the faculty of equanimity, do not understand the origination of the faculty of equanimity, do not understand the cessation of the faculty of equanimity, do not understand the path leading to the cessation of the faculty of equanimity—I do not consider them to be ascetics among ascetics or brahmins among brahmins. Nor do these venerable ones, having realized for themselves with direct knowledge, abide in this very life having attained the goal of asceticism or the goal of brahminhood.

‘‘Ye ca kho keci, bhikkhave, samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā sukhindriyaṃ pajānanti, sukhindriyasamudayaṃ pajānanti, sukhindriyanirodhaṃ pajānanti, sukhindriyanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ pajānanti; dukkhindriyaṃ pajānanti…pe… somanassindriyaṃ pajānanti… domanassindriyaṃ pajānanti… upekkhindriyaṃ pajānanti, upekkhindriyasamudayaṃ pajānanti, upekkhindriyanirodhaṃ pajānanti, upekkhindriyanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ pajānanti, te ca kho me, bhikkhave, samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā samaṇesu ceva samaṇasammatā brāhmaṇesu ca brāhmaṇasammatā, te ca panāyasmanto sāmaññatthañca brahmaññatthañca diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharantī’’ti. Pañcamaṃ.

But whatever ascetics or brahmins, bhikkhus, understand the faculty of pleasure, understand the origination of the faculty of pleasure, understand the cessation of the faculty of pleasure, understand the path leading to the cessation of the faculty of pleasure; who understand the faculty of pain… who understand the faculty of joy… who understand the faculty of sorrow… who understand the faculty of equanimity, understand the origination of the faculty of equanimity, understand the cessation of the faculty of equanimity, understand the path leading to the cessation of the faculty of equanimity—these, bhikkhus, are considered by me to be ascetics among ascetics and brahmins among brahmins. And these venerable ones, having realized for themselves with direct knowledge, abide in this very life having attained the goal of asceticism and the goal of brahminhood.” Fifth.
