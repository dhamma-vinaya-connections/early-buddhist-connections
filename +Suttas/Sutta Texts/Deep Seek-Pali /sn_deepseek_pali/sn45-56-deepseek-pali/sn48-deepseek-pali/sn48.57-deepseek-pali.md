## SN 48.57 The Sahampati Brahmā Sutta

527. Ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā uruvelāyaṃ viharati najjā nerañjarāya tīre ajapālanigrodhe paṭhamābhisambuddho. Atha kho bhagavato rahogatassa paṭisallīnassa evaṃ cetaso parivitakko udapādi – ‘‘pañcindriyāni bhāvitāni bahulīkatāni amatogadhāni honti amataparāyaṇāni amatapariyosānāni. Katamāni pañca? Saddhindriyaṃ bhāvitaṃ bahulīkataṃ amatogadhaṃ hoti amataparāyaṇaṃ amatapariyosānaṃ. Vīriyindriyaṃ…pe… satindriyaṃ…pe… samādhindriyaṃ…pe… paññindriyaṃ bhāvitaṃ bahulīkataṃ amatogadhaṃ hoti amataparāyaṇaṃ amatapariyosānaṃ. Imāni pañcindriyāni bhāvitāni bahulīkatāni amatogadhāni honti amataparāyaṇāni amatapariyosānānī’’ti.

527.On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Uruvelā, on the bank of the Nerañjarā River, at the Goatherd's Banyan Tree, just after his full enlightenment. Then, while the Blessed One was alone in seclusion, this thought arose in his mind: "The five faculties, when developed and cultivated, are immersed in the Deathless, have the Deathless as their goal, and have the Deathless as their culmination. Which five? The faculty of faith, when developed and cultivated, is immersed in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal, and has the Deathless as its culmination. The faculty of energy... The faculty of mindfulness... The faculty of concentration... The faculty of wisdom, when developed and cultivated, is immersed in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal, and has the Deathless as its culmination. These five faculties, when developed and cultivated, are immersed in the Deathless, have the Deathless as their goal, and have the Deathless as their culmination."

Atha kho brahmā sahampati bhagavato cetasā cetoparivitakkamaññāya – seyyathāpi nāma balavā puriso samiñjitaṃ vā bāhaṃ pasāreyya, pasāritaṃ vā bāhaṃ samiñjeyya; evameva brahmaloke antarahito bhagavato purato pāturahosi. Atha kho brahmā sahampati ekaṃsaṃ uttarāsaṅgaṃ karitvā yena bhagavā tenañjaliṃ paṇāmetvā bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘evametaṃ, bhagavā, evametaṃ sugata! Pañcindriyāni bhāvitāni bahulīkatāni amatogadhāni honti amataparāyaṇāni amatapariyosānāni. Katamāni pañca? Saddhindriyaṃ bhāvitaṃ bahulīkataṃ amatogadhaṃ hoti amataparāyaṇaṃ amatapariyosānaṃ…pe… paññindriyaṃ bhāvitaṃ bahulīkataṃ amatogadhaṃ hoti amataparāyaṇaṃ amatapariyosānaṃ. Imāni pañcindriyāni bhāvitāni bahulīkatāni amatogadhāni honti amataparāyaṇāni amatapariyosānāni’’.

Then Brahmā Sahampati, having known with his mind the reflection in the Blessed One's mind—just as a strong man might extend his bent arm or bend his extended arm—disappeared from the brahmā world and reappeared before the Blessed One. Then, arranging his upper robe over one shoulder, Brahmā Sahampati, extending his joined hands in reverential salutation toward the Blessed One, said to him: "So it is, Blessed One! So it is, Fortunate One! The five faculties, when developed and cultivated, are immersed in the Deathless, have the Deathless as their goal, and have the Deathless as their culmination. Which five? The faculty of faith, when developed and cultivated, is immersed in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal, and has the Deathless as its culmination... The faculty of wisdom, when developed and cultivated, is immersed in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal, and has the Deathless as its culmination. These five faculties, when developed and cultivated, are immersed in the Deathless, have the Deathless as their goal, and have the Deathless as their culmination."

‘‘Bhūtapubbāhaṃ, bhante, kassape sammāsambuddhe brahmacariyaṃ acariṃ. Tatrapi maṃ evaṃ jānanti – ‘sahako bhikkhu, sahako bhikkhū’ti. So khvāhaṃ, bhante, imesaṃyeva pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ bhāvitattā bahulīkatattā kāmesu kāmacchandaṃ virājetvā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ brahmalokaṃ upapanno. Tatrapi maṃ evaṃ jānanti – ‘brahmā sahampati, brahmā sahampatī’’’ti. ‘‘Evametaṃ, bhagavā, evametaṃ sugata! Ahametaṃ jānāmi, ahametaṃ passāmi yathā imāni pañcindriyāni bhāvitāni bahulīkatāni amatogadhāni honti amataparāyaṇāni amatapariyosānānī’’ti. Sattamaṃ.

"Once, venerable sir, I lived the holy life under the Perfectly Self-Enlightened Kassapa. There, too, they knew me as ‘the monk Sahaka, the monk Sahaka.’ Indeed, venerable sir, because I had developed and cultivated these very five faculties, I abandoned desire for sensual pleasures, and after the breakup of the body, after death, I was reborn in a good destination, the brahmā world. There, too, they knew me as ‘Brahmā Sahampati, Brahmā Sahampati.’" "So it is, Blessed One! So it is, Fortunate One! I know this, I see this: how these five faculties, when developed and cultivated, are immersed in the Deathless, have the Deathless as their goal, and have the Deathless as their culmination." The seventh.
