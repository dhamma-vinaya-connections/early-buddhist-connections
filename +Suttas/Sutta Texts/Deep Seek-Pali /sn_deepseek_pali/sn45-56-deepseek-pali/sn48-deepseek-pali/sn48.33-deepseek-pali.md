# SN 48.33 Arahantasuttaṃ

## SN 48.33 The Arahant Sutta

503. ‘‘Pañcimāni, bhikkhave, indriyāni. Katamāni pañca? Sukhindriyaṃ, dukkhindriyaṃ, somanassindriyaṃ, domanassindriyaṃ, upekkhindriyaṃ. Yato kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu imesaṃ pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ viditvā anupādāvimutto hoti – ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, bhikkhu arahaṃ khīṇāsavo vusitavā katakaraṇīyo ohitabhāro anuppattasadattho parikkhīṇabhavasaṃyojano sammadaññā vimutto’’ti. Tatiyaṃ.

503.“Bhikkhus, there are these five faculties. What five? The faculty of pleasure, the faculty of pain, the faculty of joy, the faculty of sorrow, and the faculty of equanimity. When, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands as it really is the origination, disappearance, gratification, danger, and escape in regard to these five faculties, and is liberated by non-clinging, he is called a bhikkhu who is an arahant, whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own goal, whose fetters of existence are utterly destroyed, and who is liberated by perfect knowledge.” Third.
