# SN 48.18 Paṭipannasuttaṃ

## SN 48.18 The Discourse on Those Practicing.

488. ‘‘Pañcimāni, bhikkhave, indriyāni. Katamāni pañca? Saddhindriyaṃ…pe… paññindriyaṃ – imāni kho, bhikkhave, pañcindriyāni. Imesaṃ kho, bhikkhave, pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ samattā paripūrattā arahaṃ hoti, tato mudutarehi arahattaphalasacchikiriyāya paṭipanno hoti, tato mudutarehi anāgāmī hoti, tato mudutarehi anāgāmiphalasacchikiriyāya paṭipanno hoti, tato mudutarehi sakadāgāmī hoti, tato mudutarehi sakadāgāmiphalasacchikiriyāya paṭipanno hoti, tato mudutarehi sotāpanno hoti, tato mudutarehi sotāpattiphalasacchikiriyāya paṭipanno hoti. Yassa kho, bhikkhave, imāni pañcindriyāni sabbena sabbaṃ sabbathā sabbaṃ natthi, tamahaṃ ‘bāhiro puthujjanapakkhe ṭhito’ti vadāmī’’ti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

488."Monks, there are these five faculties. Which five? The faculty of faith ... the faculty of wisdom—these, monks, are the five faculties. Monks, by virtue of the completion and perfection of these five faculties, one is an arahant. If they are somewhat weaker than that, one is practicing for the realization of the fruit of arahantship. If they are somewhat weaker than that, one is a non-returner. If they are somewhat weaker than that, one is practicing for the realization of the fruit of non-returning. If they are somewhat weaker than that, one is a once-returner. If they are somewhat weaker than that, one is practicing for the realization of the fruit of once-returning. If they are somewhat weaker than that, one is a stream-enterer. If they are somewhat weaker than that, one is practicing for the realization of the fruit of stream-entry. But monks, one in whom these five faculties are entirely and utterly absent, I declare that person to be an outsider, one who stands in the ranks of ordinary people." The eighth.
