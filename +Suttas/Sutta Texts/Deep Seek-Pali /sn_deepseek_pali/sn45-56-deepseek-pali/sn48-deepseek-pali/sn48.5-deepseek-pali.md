# SN 48.5 Dutiyaarahantasuttaṃ

## SN 48.5 The Second Arahant Discourse

475. ‘‘Pañcimāni, bhikkhave, indriyāni. Katamāni pañca? Saddhindriyaṃ, vīriyindriyaṃ, satindriyaṃ, samādhindriyaṃ, paññindriyaṃ. Yato kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu imesaṃ pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ viditvā anupādāvimutto hoti – ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, bhikkhu arahaṃ khīṇāsavo vusitavā katakaraṇīyo ohitabhāro anuppattasadattho parikkhīṇabhavasaṃyojano sammadaññā vimutto’’ti. Pañcamaṃ.

475.“Monks, there are these five faculties. Which five? The faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of wisdom. When, monks, a monk, having directly known as they really are the arising and passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to these five faculties, is liberated without clinging, this is called, monks, a monk who is an arahant, with taints destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own welfare, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, and is liberated by perfect knowledge.” The fifth.
