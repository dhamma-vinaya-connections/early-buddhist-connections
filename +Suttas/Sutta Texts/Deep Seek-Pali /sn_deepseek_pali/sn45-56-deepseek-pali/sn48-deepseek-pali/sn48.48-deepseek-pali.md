518.The same setting. "Monks, through the development and cultivation of how many faculties does a monk, whose taints are destroyed, declare final knowledge: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being'?" "Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One..." "Monks, it is through the development and cultivation of five faculties that a monk, whose taints are destroyed, declares final knowledge: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.' Which five? The faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of wisdom. It is through the development and cultivation of these five faculties that a monk, whose taints are destroyed, declares final knowledge: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.'" The eighth.
