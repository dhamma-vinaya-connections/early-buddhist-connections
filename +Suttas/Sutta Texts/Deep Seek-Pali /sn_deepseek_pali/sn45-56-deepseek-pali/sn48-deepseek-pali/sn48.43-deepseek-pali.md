## SN 48.43 The Sāketa Sutta

513. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sākete viharati añjanavane migadāye. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘atthi nu kho, bhikkhave, pariyāyo yaṃ pariyāyaṃ āgamma yāni pañcindriyāni tāni pañca balāni honti, yāni pañca balāni tāni pañcindriyāni hontī’’ti?

513.Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāketa in the Añjana Grove, the deer park. There the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Is there, monks, a method by which, resorting to that method, the five faculties become the five powers, and the five powers become the five faculties?"

‘‘Bhagavaṃmūlakā no, bhante, dhammā bhagavaṃnettikā bhagavaṃpaṭisaraṇā. Sādhu vata, bhante, bhagavantaṃyeva paṭibhātu etassa bhāsitassa attho. Bhagavato sutvā bhikkhū dhāressantī’’ti. ‘‘Atthi, bhikkhave, pariyāyo yaṃ pariyāyaṃ āgamma yāni pañcindriyāni tāni pañca balāni honti, yāni pañca balāni tāni pañcindriyāni honti’’.

"Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, and have the Blessed One as their refuge. It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One himself would illuminate the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the monks will remember it.""There is, monks, a method by which, relying on that method, the five faculties become the five powers, and the five powers become the five faculties."

‘‘Katamo ca, bhikkhave, pariyāyo yaṃ pariyāyaṃ āgamma yāni pañcindriyāni tāni pañca balāni honti, yāni pañca balāni tāni pañcindriyāni honti? Yaṃ, bhikkhave, saddhindriyaṃ taṃ saddhābalaṃ, yaṃ saddhābalaṃ taṃ saddhindriyaṃ; yaṃ vīriyindriyaṃ taṃ vīriyabalaṃ, yaṃ vīriyabalaṃ taṃ vīriyindriyaṃ; yaṃ satindriyaṃ taṃ satibalaṃ, yaṃ satibalaṃ taṃ satindriyaṃ; yaṃ samādhindriyaṃ taṃ samādhibalaṃ, yaṃ samādhibalaṃ taṃ samādhindriyaṃ; yaṃ paññindriyaṃ taṃ paññābalaṃ, yaṃ paññābalaṃ taṃ paññindriyaṃ. Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, nadī pācīnaninnā pācīnapoṇā pācīnapabbhārā, tassa majjhe dīpo. Atthi, bhikkhave, pariyāyo yaṃ pariyāyaṃ āgamma tassā nadiyā eko soto tveva saṅkhyaṃ gacchati [saṅkhaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ.)]. Atthi pana, bhikkhave, pariyāyo yaṃ pariyāyaṃ āgamma tassā nadiyā dve sotāni tveva saṅkhyaṃ gacchanti.

"And what, monks, is the way by which, by resorting to which way, the five faculties become the five powers, and the five powers become the five faculties? Whatever, monks, is the faculty of faith, that is the power of faith; whatever is the power of faith, that is the faculty of faith. Whatever is the faculty of energy, that is the power of energy; whatever is the power of energy, that is the faculty of energy. Whatever is the faculty of mindfulness, that is the power of mindfulness; whatever is the power of mindfulness, that is the faculty of mindfulness. Whatever is the faculty of concentration, that is the power of concentration; whatever is the power of concentration, that is the faculty of concentration. Whatever is the faculty of wisdom, that is the power of wisdom; whatever is the power of wisdom, that is the faculty of wisdom. Just as, monks, a river flows eastward, inclines eastward, slopes eastward, and in the middle of it there is an island. There is, monks, a way by which, by resorting to which way, that river is reckoned as one stream. But there is also, monks, a way by which, by resorting to which way, that river is reckoned as two streams."

‘‘Katamo ca, bhikkhave, pariyāyo yaṃ pariyāyaṃ āgamma tassā nadiyā eko soto tveva saṅkhyaṃ gacchati? Yañca, bhikkhave, tassa dīpassa purimante [puratthimante (sī. syā. kaṃ. pī.)] udakaṃ, yañca pacchimante udakaṃ – ayaṃ kho, bhikkhave, pariyāyo yaṃ pariyāyaṃ āgamma tassā nadiyā eko soto tveva saṅkhyaṃ gacchati.

"And what, monks, is the way by which that river is reckoned as having one current? The water at the eastern bank of that island, monks, and the water at the western bank—this, monks, is the way by which that river is reckoned as having one current."

‘‘Katamo ca, bhikkhave, pariyāyo yaṃ pariyāyaṃ āgamma tassā nadiyā dve sotāni tveva saṅkhyaṃ gacchanti? Yañca, bhikkhave, tassa dīpassa uttarante udakaṃ, yañca dakkhiṇante udakaṃ – ayaṃ kho, bhikkhave, pariyāyo yaṃ pariyāyaṃ āgamma tassā nadiyā dve sotāni tveva saṅkhyaṃ gacchanti. Evameva kho, bhikkhave, yaṃ saddhindriyaṃ taṃ saddhābalaṃ, yaṃ saddhābalaṃ taṃ saddhindriyaṃ; yaṃ vīriyindriyaṃ taṃ vīriyabalaṃ, yaṃ vīriyabalaṃ taṃ vīriyindriyaṃ; yaṃ satindriyaṃ taṃ satibalaṃ, yaṃ satibalaṃ taṃ satindriyaṃ; yaṃ samādhindriyaṃ taṃ samādhibalaṃ, yaṃ samādhibalaṃ taṃ samādhindriyaṃ; yaṃ paññindriyaṃ taṃ paññābalaṃ, yaṃ paññābalaṃ taṃ paññindriyaṃ. Pañcannaṃ, bhikkhave, indriyānaṃ bhāvitattā bahulīkatattā bhikkhu āsavānaṃ khayā anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharatī’’ti. Tatiyaṃ.

"And what, monks, is the way by which that river is reckoned as having two streams? The water on the northern shore of that island, monks, and the water on the southern shore—this, monks, is the way by which that river is reckoned as having two streams. In the same way, monks, the faculty of faith is the power of faith, and the power of faith is the faculty of faith. The faculty of energy is the power of energy, and the power of energy is the faculty of energy. The faculty of mindfulness is the power of mindfulness, and the power of mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness. The faculty of concentration is the power of concentration, and the power of concentration is the faculty of concentration. The faculty of wisdom is the power of wisdom, and the power of wisdom is the faculty of wisdom. When, monks, a monk has developed and cultivated these five faculties, by destroying the taints, they enter and dwell in the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, having realized it for themselves with direct knowledge in this very life." (The third.)
