## SN 48.44 The Eastern Gatehouse Discourse

514. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati pubbakoṭṭhake. Tatra kho bhagavā āyasmantaṃ sāriputtaṃ āmantesi – ‘‘saddahasi [saddahāsi (sī. pī.)] tvaṃ, sāriputta – saddhindriyaṃ bhāvitaṃ bahulīkataṃ amatogadhaṃ hoti amataparāyaṇaṃ amatapariyosānaṃ…pe… paññindriyaṃ bhāvitaṃ bahulīkataṃ amatogadhaṃ hoti amataparāyaṇaṃ amatapariyosāna’’nti?

514.Thus have I heard: At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in the Eastern Gatehouse. There the Blessed One addressed Venerable Sāriputta: "Do you believe, Sāriputta, that the faculty of faith, when developed and cultivated, has the Deathless as its ground, the Deathless as its destination, the Deathless as its culmination...the faculty of wisdom, when developed and cultivated, has the Deathless as its ground, the Deathless as its destination, the Deathless as its culmination?"

‘‘Na khvāhaṃ ettha, bhante, bhagavato saddhāya gacchāmi – saddhindriyaṃ…pe… paññindriyaṃ bhāvitaṃ bahulīkataṃ amatogadhaṃ hoti amataparāyaṇaṃ amatapariyosānaṃ. Yesañhetaṃ, bhante, aññātaṃ assa adiṭṭhaṃ aviditaṃ asacchikataṃ aphassitaṃ [apassitaṃ (sī. syā. kaṃ. ka.), aphusitaṃ (pī.)] paññāya, te tattha paresaṃ saddhāya gaccheyyuṃ – saddhindriyaṃ…pe… paññindriyaṃ bhāvitaṃ bahulīkataṃ amatogadhaṃ hoti amataparāyaṇaṃ amatapariyosānaṃ. Yesañca kho etaṃ, bhante, ñātaṃ diṭṭhaṃ viditaṃ sacchikataṃ phassitaṃ paññāya, nikkaṅkhā te tattha nibbicikicchā – saddhindriyaṃ…pe… paññindriyaṃ bhāvitaṃ bahulīkataṃ amatogadhaṃ hoti amataparāyaṇaṃ amatapariyosānaṃ. Mayhañca kho etaṃ, bhante, ñātaṃ diṭṭhaṃ viditaṃ sacchikataṃ phassitaṃ paññāya. Nikkaṅkhavāhaṃ tattha nibbicikiccho saddhindriyaṃ…pe… paññindriyaṃ bhāvitaṃ bahulīkataṃ amatogadhaṃ hoti amataparāyaṇaṃ amatapariyosāna’’nti.

Indeed, venerable sir, I do not go by faith in the Blessed One in this matter—the faculty of faith… the faculty of wisdom, when developed and cultivated, has the Deathless as its ground, the Deathless as its destination, the Deathless as its culmination. For those, venerable sir, for whom this is unknown, unseen, ununderstood, unrealized, and uncontacted by wisdom, they might go by faith in others—the faculty of faith… the faculty of wisdom, when developed and cultivated, has the Deathless as its ground, the Deathless as its destination, the Deathless as its culmination. But for those, venerable sir, for whom this is known, seen, understood, realized, and contacted by wisdom, they are without doubt and uncertainty in this matter—the faculty of faith… the faculty of wisdom, when developed and cultivated, has the Deathless as its ground, the Deathless as its destination, the Deathless as its culmination. And for me, venerable sir, this is known, seen, understood, realized, and contacted by wisdom. I am without doubt and uncertainty in this matter—the faculty of faith… the faculty of wisdom, when developed and cultivated, has the Deathless as its ground, the Deathless as its destination, the Deathless as its culmination.

‘‘Sādhu sādhu, sāriputta! Yesañhetaṃ, sāriputta, aññātaṃ assa adiṭṭhaṃ aviditaṃ asacchikataṃ aphassitaṃ paññāya, te tattha paresaṃ saddhāya gaccheyyuṃ – saddhindriyaṃ bhāvitaṃ bahulīkataṃ amatogadhaṃ hoti amataparāyaṇaṃ amatapariyosānaṃ…pe… paññindriyaṃ bhāvitaṃ bahulīkataṃ amatogadhaṃ hoti amataparāyaṇaṃ amatapariyosānaṃ. Yesañca kho etaṃ, sāriputta, ñātaṃ diṭṭhaṃ viditaṃ sacchikataṃ phassitaṃ paññāya, nikkaṅkhā te tattha nibbicikicchā – saddhindriyaṃ bhāvitaṃ bahulīkataṃ amatogadhaṃ hoti amataparāyaṇaṃ amatapariyosānaṃ…pe… paññindriyaṃ bhāvitaṃ bahulīkataṃ amatogadhaṃ hoti amataparāyaṇaṃ amatapariyosāna’’nti. Catutthaṃ.

Good, good, Sāriputta! For those, Sāriputta, for whom this is unknown, unseen, ununderstood, unrealized, and uncontacted by wisdom, they might go by faith in others—the faculty of faith, when developed and cultivated, has the Deathless as its ground, the Deathless as its destination, the Deathless as its culmination… the faculty of wisdom, when developed and cultivated, has the Deathless as its ground, the Deathless as its destination, the Deathless as its culmination. But for those, Sāriputta, for whom this is known, seen, understood, realized, and contacted by wisdom, they are without doubt and uncertainty—the faculty of faith, when developed and cultivated, has the Deathless as its ground, the Deathless as its destination, the Deathless as its culmination… the faculty of wisdom, when developed and cultivated, has the Deathless as its ground, the Deathless as its destination, the Deathless as its culmination." The fourth.
