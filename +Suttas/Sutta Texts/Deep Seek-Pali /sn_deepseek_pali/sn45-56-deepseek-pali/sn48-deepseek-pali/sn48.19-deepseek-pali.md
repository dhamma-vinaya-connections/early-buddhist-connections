# SN 48.19 Sampannasuttaṃ

## SN 48.19 The Accomplished Discourse

489. Atha kho aññataro bhikkhu yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho so bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca –

489.Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. As he sat to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One:

‘‘‘Indriyasampanno, indriyasampanno’ti, bhante, vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho, bhante, indriyasampanno hotī’’ti? ‘‘Idha, bhikkhu, bhikkhu saddhindriyaṃ bhāveti upasamagāmiṃ sambodhagāmiṃ, vīriyindriyaṃ bhāveti upasamagāmiṃ sambodhagāmiṃ, satindriyaṃ bhāveti upasamagāmiṃ sambodhagāmiṃ, samādhindriyaṃ bhāveti upasamagāmiṃ sambodhagāmiṃ, paññindriyaṃ bhāveti upasamagāmiṃ sambodhagāmiṃ. Ettāvatā kho, bhikkhu, bhikkhu indriyasampanno hotī’’ti. Navamaṃ.

“‘One accomplished in the faculties, one accomplished in the faculties,’ it is said, venerable sir. To what extent, venerable sir, is one accomplished in the faculties?” “Here, bhikkhu, a bhikkhu develops the faculty of faith, which leads to peace, leads to enlightenment; he develops the faculty of energy, which leads to peace, leads to enlightenment; he develops the faculty of mindfulness, which leads to peace, leads to enlightenment; he develops the faculty of concentration, which leads to peace, leads to enlightenment; he develops the faculty of wisdom, which leads to peace, leads to enlightenment. To this extent, bhikkhu, a bhikkhu is accomplished in the faculties.” Ninth.
