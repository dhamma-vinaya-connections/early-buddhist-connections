478. ‘‘Pañcimāni, bhikkhave, indriyāni. Katamāni pañca? Saddhindriyaṃ…pe… paññindriyaṃ. Kattha ca, bhikkhave, saddhindriyaṃ daṭṭhabbaṃ? Catūsu sotāpattiyaṅgesu – ettha saddhindriyaṃ daṭṭhabbaṃ. Kattha ca, bhikkhave, vīriyindriyaṃ daṭṭhabbaṃ? Catūsu sammappadhānesu – ettha vīriyindriyaṃ daṭṭhabbaṃ. Kattha ca, bhikkhave, satindriyaṃ daṭṭhabbaṃ? Catūsu satipaṭṭhānesu – ettha satindriyaṃ daṭṭhabbaṃ. Kattha ca, bhikkhave, samādhindriyaṃ daṭṭhabbaṃ? Catūsu jhānesu – ettha samādhindriyaṃ daṭṭhabbaṃ. Kattha ca, bhikkhave, paññindriyaṃ daṭṭhabbaṃ? Catūsu ariyasaccesu – ettha paññindriyaṃ daṭṭhabbaṃ. Imāni kho, bhikkhave, pañcindriyānī’’ti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

478."Bhikkhus, there are these five faculties. Which five? The faculty of faith [...] the faculty of wisdom. And where, Bhikkhus, is the faculty of faith to be seen? In the four factors of stream-entry—there the faculty of faith is to be seen. And where, Bhikkhus, is the faculty of energy to be seen? In the four right exertions—there the faculty of energy is to be seen. And where, Bhikkhus, is the faculty of mindfulness to be seen? In the four foundations of mindfulness—there the faculty of mindfulness is to be seen. And where, Bhikkhus, is the faculty of concentration to be seen? In the four jhānas—there the faculty of concentration is to be seen. And where, Bhikkhus, is the faculty of wisdom to be seen? In the four noble truths—there the faculty of wisdom is to be seen. These, Bhikkhus, are the five faculties." The eighth.
