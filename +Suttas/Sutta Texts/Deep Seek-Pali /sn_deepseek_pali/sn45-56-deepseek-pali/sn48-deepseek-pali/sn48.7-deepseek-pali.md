# SN 48.7 Dutiyasamaṇabrāhmaṇasuttaṃ

## SN 48.7 The Second Discourse about Recluses and Brahmins

477. ‘‘Ye hi keci, bhikkhave, samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā saddhindriyaṃ nappajānanti, saddhindriyasamudayaṃ nappajānanti, saddhindriyanirodhaṃ nappajānanti, saddhindriyanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ nappajānanti; vīriyindriyaṃ nappajānanti…pe… satindriyaṃ nappajānanti …pe… samādhindriyaṃ nappajānanti…pe… paññindriyaṃ nappajānanti, paññindriyasamudayaṃ nappajānanti, paññindriyanirodhaṃ nappajānanti, paññindriyanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ nappajānanti, na me te, bhikkhave samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā samaṇesu vā samaṇasammatā brāhmaṇesu vā brāhmaṇasammatā, na ca panete āyasmanto sāmaññatthaṃ vā brahmaññatthaṃ vā diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharanti.

477.“Monks, any recluses or brahmins who do not know the faculty of faith, do not know the origin of the faculty of faith, do not know the cessation of the faculty of faith, do not know the way leading to the cessation of the faculty of faith; who do not know the faculty of energy, do not know the origin of the faculty of energy, do not know the cessation of the faculty of energy, do not know the way leading to the cessation of the faculty of energy; who do not know the faculty of mindfulness, do not know the origin of the faculty of mindfulness, do not know the cessation of the faculty of mindfulness, do not know the way leading to the cessation of the faculty of mindfulness; who do not know the faculty of concentration, do not know the origin of the faculty of concentration, do not know the cessation of the faculty of concentration, do not know the way leading to the cessation of the faculty of concentration; who do not know the faculty of wisdom, do not know the origin of the faculty of wisdom, do not know the cessation of the faculty of wisdom, do not know the way leading to the cessation of the faculty of wisdom—they are not reckoned by me as recluses among recluses or as brahmins among brahmins. Nor do those venerable ones, having realized for themselves with direct knowledge, abide having attained the goal of recluseship or the goal of brahminhood in this very life.”

‘‘Ye ca kho keci, bhikkhave, samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā saddhindriyaṃ pajānanti, saddhindriyasamudayaṃ pajānanti, saddhindriyanirodhaṃ pajānanti, saddhindriyanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ pajānanti; vīriyindriyaṃ pajānanti, vīriyindriyasamudayaṃ pajānanti, vīriyindriyanirodhaṃ pajānanti, vīriyindriyanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ pajānanti; satindriyaṃ pajānanti…pe… samādhindriyaṃ pajānanti…pe… paññindriyaṃ pajānanti, paññindriyasamudayaṃ pajānanti, paññindriyanirodhaṃ pajānanti, paññindriyanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ pajānanti, te kho me, bhikkhave, samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā samaṇesu ceva samaṇasammatā brāhmaṇesu ca brāhmaṇasammatā, te ca panāyasmanto sāmaññatthañca brahmaññatthañca diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharantī’’ti. Sattamaṃ.

“But, monks, whatever recluses or brahmins know the faculty of faith, know the origin of the faculty of faith, know the cessation of the faculty of faith, know the way leading to the cessation of the faculty of faith; know the faculty of energy, know the origin of the faculty of energy, know the cessation of the faculty of energy, know the way leading to the cessation of the faculty of energy; know the faculty of mindfulness, know the origin of the faculty of mindfulness, know the cessation of the faculty of mindfulness, know the way leading to the cessation of the faculty of mindfulness; know the faculty of concentration, know the origin of the faculty of concentration, know the cessation of the faculty of concentration, know the way leading to the cessation of the faculty of concentration; know the faculty of wisdom, know the origin of the faculty of wisdom, know the cessation of the faculty of wisdom, know the way leading to the cessation of the faculty of wisdom—they are reckoned by me as recluses among recluses and as brahmins among brahmins. And those venerable ones, having realized for themselves with direct knowledge, abide having attained the goal of recluseship and the goal of brahminhood in this very life.” The seventh.
