## SN 48.40 The Upside-Down Discourse.

510. ‘‘Pañcimāni, bhikkhave, indriyāni. Katamāni pañca? Dukkhindriyaṃ, domanassindriyaṃ, sukhindriyaṃ, somanassindriyaṃ, upekkhindriyaṃ. Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato uppajjati dukkhindriyaṃ. So evaṃ pajānāti – ‘uppannaṃ kho me idaṃ dukkhindriyaṃ, tañca kho sanimittaṃ sanidānaṃ sasaṅkhāraṃ sappaccayaṃ. Tañca animittaṃ anidānaṃ asaṅkhāraṃ appaccayaṃ dukkhindriyaṃ uppajjissatīti – netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati’. So dukkhindriyañca pajānāti, dukkhindriyasamudayañca pajānāti, dukkhindriyanirodhañca pajānāti, yattha cuppannaṃ dukkhindriyaṃ aparisesaṃ nirujjhati tañca pajānāti. Kattha cuppannaṃ dukkhindriyaṃ aparisesaṃ nirujjhati? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati, ettha cuppannaṃ dukkhindriyaṃ aparisesaṃ nirujjhati. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, ‘bhikkhu aññāsi dukkhindriyassa nirodhaṃ, tadatthāya cittaṃ upasaṃharati’’’.

510.“Monks, there are these five faculties. Which five? The faculty of pain, the faculty of displeasure, the faculty of pleasure, the faculty of joy, and the faculty of equanimity. Here, monks, when a monk dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, the faculty of pain arises. He understands thus: ‘This faculty of pain has arisen in me, and it has a sign, a source, a formation, and a condition. But there is no possibility that a faculty of pain could arise without a sign, without a source, without a formation, without a condition.’ He understands the faculty of pain, the origin of the faculty of pain, the cessation of the faculty of pain, and where the arisen faculty of pain ceases without remainder. Where does the arisen faculty of pain cease without remainder? Here, monks, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome qualities, a monk enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion. There, the arisen faculty of pain ceases without remainder. This, monks, is called ‘a monk who has understood the cessation of the faculty of pain and directs the mind to that end.’

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato uppajjati domanassindriyaṃ. So evaṃ pajānāti – ‘uppannaṃ kho me idaṃ domanassindriyaṃ, tañca kho sanimittaṃ sanidānaṃ sasaṅkhāraṃ sappaccayaṃ. Tañca animittaṃ anidānaṃ asaṅkhāraṃ appaccayaṃ domanassindriyaṃ uppajjissatīti – netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati’. So domanassindriyañca pajānāti, domanassindriyasamudayañca pajānāti, domanassindriyanirodhañca pajānāti, yattha cuppannaṃ domanassindriyaṃ aparisesaṃ nirujjhati tañca pajānāti. Kattha cuppannaṃ domanassindriyaṃ aparisesaṃ nirujjhati? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vitakkavicārānaṃ vūpasamā ajjhattaṃ sampasādanaṃ cetaso ekodibhāvaṃ avitakkaṃ avicāraṃ samādhijaṃ pītisukhaṃ dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati, ettha cuppannaṃ domanassindriyaṃ aparisesaṃ nirujjhati. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, ‘bhikkhu aññāsi domanassindriyassa nirodhaṃ, tadatthāya cittaṃ upasaṃharati’’’.

“Here, monks, when a monk dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, the faculty of displeasure arises. He understands thus: ‘This faculty of displeasure has arisen in me, and it has a sign, a source, a formation, and a condition. But there is no possibility that a faculty of displeasure could arise without a sign, without a source, without a formation, without a condition.’ He understands the faculty of displeasure, the origin of the faculty of displeasure, the cessation of the faculty of displeasure, and where the arisen faculty of displeasure ceases without remainder. Where does the arisen faculty of displeasure cease without remainder? Here, monks, with the stilling of thought and examination, a monk enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal assurance and unification of mind, is without thought and examination, and is born of concentration with rapture and happiness. There, the arisen faculty of displeasure ceases without remainder. This, monks, is called ‘a monk who has understood the cessation of the faculty of displeasure and directs the mind to that end.’

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato uppajjati sukhindriyaṃ. So evaṃ pajānāti – ‘uppannaṃ kho me idaṃ sukhindriyaṃ, tañca kho sanimittaṃ sanidānaṃ sasaṅkhāraṃ sappaccayaṃ. Tañca animittaṃ anidānaṃ asaṅkhāraṃ appaccayaṃ sukhindriyaṃ uppajjissatīti – netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati’. So sukhindriyañca pajānāti, sukhindriyasamudayañca pajānāti, sukhindriyanirodhañca pajānāti, yattha cuppannaṃ sukhindriyaṃ aparisesaṃ nirujjhati tañca pajānāti. Kattha cuppannaṃ sukhindriyaṃ aparisesaṃ nirujjhati? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pītiyā ca virāgā upekkhako ca viharati sato ca sampajāno sukhañca kāyena paṭisaṃvedeti yaṃ taṃ ariyā ācikkhanti ‘upekkhako satimā sukhavihārī’ti tatiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati, ettha cuppannaṃ sukhindriyaṃ aparisesaṃ nirujjhati. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, ‘bhikkhu aññāsi sukhindriyassa nirodhaṃ, tadatthāya cittaṃ upasaṃharati’’’.

“Here, monks, when a monk dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, the faculty of pleasure arises. He understands thus: ‘This faculty of pleasure has arisen in me, and it has a sign, a source, a formation, and a condition. But there is no possibility that a faculty of pleasure could arise without a sign, without a source, without a formation, without a condition.’ He understands the faculty of pleasure, the origin of the faculty of pleasure, the cessation of the faculty of pleasure, and where the arisen faculty of pleasure ceases without remainder. Where does the arisen faculty of pleasure cease without remainder? Here, monks, with the fading of rapture, a monk dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending, and experiences pleasure with the body, of which the noble ones declare: ‘Equanimous and mindful, he dwells happily.’ He enters and dwells in the third jhāna. There, the arisen faculty of pleasure ceases without remainder. This, monks, is called ‘a monk who has understood the cessation of the faculty of pleasure and directs the mind to that end.’

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato uppajjati somanassindriyaṃ. So evaṃ pajānāti – ‘uppannaṃ kho me idaṃ somanassindriyaṃ, tañca kho sanimittaṃ sanidānaṃ sasaṅkhāraṃ sappaccayaṃ. Tañca animittaṃ anidānaṃ asaṅkhāraṃ appaccayaṃ somanassindriyaṃ uppajjissatīti – netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati’. So somanassindriyañca pajānāti, somanassindriyasamudayañca pajānāti, somanassindriyanirodhañca pajānāti, yattha cuppannaṃ somanassindriyaṃ aparisesaṃ nirujjhati tañca pajānāti. Kattha cuppannaṃ somanassindriyaṃ aparisesaṃ nirujjhati? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sukhassa ca pahānā dukkhassa ca pahānā pubbeva somanassadomanassānaṃ atthaṅgamā adukkhamasukhaṃ upekkhāsatipārisuddhiṃ catutthaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati, ettha cuppannaṃ somanassindriyaṃ aparisesaṃ nirujjhati. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, ‘bhikkhu aññāsi somanassindriyassa nirodhaṃ, tadatthāya cittaṃ upasaṃharati’’’.

“Here, monks, when a monk dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, the faculty of joy arises. He understands thus: ‘This faculty of joy has arisen in me, and it has a sign, a source, a formation, and a condition. But there is no possibility that a faculty of joy could arise without a sign, without a source, without a formation, without a condition.’ He understands the faculty of joy, the origin of the faculty of joy, the cessation of the faculty of joy, and where the arisen faculty of joy ceases without remainder. Where does the arisen faculty of joy cease without remainder? Here, monks, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the prior passing away of joy and sorrow, a monk enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is neither painful nor pleasant, and with the purification of mindfulness by equanimity. There, the arisen faculty of joy ceases without remainder. This, monks, is called ‘a monk who has understood the cessation of the faculty of joy and directs the mind to that end.’

‘‘Idha pana, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato uppajjati upekkhindriyaṃ. So evaṃ pajānāti – ‘uppannaṃ kho me idaṃ upekkhindriyaṃ, tañca kho sanimittaṃ sanidānaṃ sasaṅkhāraṃ sappaccayaṃ. Tañca animittaṃ anidānaṃ asaṅkhāraṃ appaccayaṃ upekkhindriyaṃ uppajjissatīti – netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati’. So upekkhindriyañca pajānāti, upekkhindriyasamudayañca pajānāti, upekkhindriyanirodhañca pajānāti, yattha cuppannaṃ upekkhindriyaṃ aparisesaṃ nirujjhati tañca pajānāti. Kattha cuppannaṃ upekkhindriyaṃ aparisesaṃ nirujjhati? Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sabbaso nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṃ samatikkamma saññāvedayitanirodhaṃ upasampajja viharati, ettha cuppannaṃ upekkhindriyaṃ aparisesaṃ nirujjhati. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, ‘bhikkhu aññāsi upekkhindriyassa nirodhaṃ, tadatthāya cittaṃ upasaṃharatī’’’ti. Dasamaṃ.

“Here, monks, when a monk dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, the faculty of equanimity arises. He understands thus: ‘This faculty of equanimity has arisen in me, and it has a sign, a source, a formation, and a condition. But there is no possibility that a faculty of equanimity could arise without a sign, without a source, without a formation, without a condition.’ He understands the faculty of equanimity, the origin of the faculty of equanimity, the cessation of the faculty of equanimity, and where the arisen faculty of equanimity ceases without remainder. Where does the arisen faculty of equanimity cease without remainder? Here, monks, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a monk enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling. There, the arisen faculty of equanimity ceases without remainder. This, monks, is called ‘a monk who has understood the cessation of the faculty of equanimity and directs the mind to that end.’ ” The tenth.
