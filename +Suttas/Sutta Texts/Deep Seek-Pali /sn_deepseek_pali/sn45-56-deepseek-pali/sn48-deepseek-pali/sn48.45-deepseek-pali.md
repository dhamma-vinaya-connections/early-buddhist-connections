# SN 48.45 Paṭhamapubbārāmasuttaṃ

## SN 48.45 The First Discourse at Pubbārāma

515. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati pubbārāme migāramātupāsāde. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘katinaṃ nu kho, bhikkhave, indriyānaṃ bhāvitattā bahulīkatattā khīṇāsavo bhikkhu aññaṃ byākaroti – ‘khīṇā jāti, vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ, kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ, nāparaṃ itthattāyā’ti pajānāmī’’ti?

515.Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in the Eastern Park, in the mansion of Migāra's mother. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, through the development and cultivation of how many faculties does a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed declare: 'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what was to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being'?"

Bhagavaṃmūlakā no, bhante, dhammā…pe… ‘‘ekassa kho, bhikkhave, indriyassa bhāvitattā bahulīkatattā khīṇāsavo bhikkhu aññaṃ byākaroti – ‘khīṇā jāti, vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ, kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ, nāparaṃ itthattāyā’ti pajānāmīti. Katamassa ekassa paññindriyassa paññavato, bhikkhave, ariyasāvakassa tadanvayā saddhā saṇṭhāti, tadanvayaṃ vīriyaṃ saṇṭhāti, tadanvayā sati saṇṭhāti, tadanvayo samādhi saṇṭhāti. Imassa kho, bhikkhave, ekassa indriyassa bhāvitattā bahulīkatattā khīṇāsavo bhikkhu aññaṃ byākaroti – ‘khīṇā jāti, vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ, kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ, nāparaṃ itthattāyā’ti pajānāmī’’ti. Pañcamaṃ.

Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One…" "Bhikkhus, through the development and cultivation of one faculty, a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed declares: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what was to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’ Which one? The faculty of wisdom. Bhikkhus, for a wise noble disciple, faith is established in accordance with that, energy is established in accordance with that, mindfulness is established in accordance with that, concentration is established in accordance with that. Bhikkhus, through the development and cultivation of this one faculty, a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed declares: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what was to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’" The fifth.
