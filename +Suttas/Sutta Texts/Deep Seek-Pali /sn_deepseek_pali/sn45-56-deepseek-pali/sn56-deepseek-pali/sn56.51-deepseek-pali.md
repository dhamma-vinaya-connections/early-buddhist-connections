# SN 56.51 Nakhasikhasuttaṃ

## SN 56.51 The Fingernail Tip Discourse

1121. Atha kho bhagavā parittaṃ nakhasikhāyaṃ paṃsuṃ āropetvā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘taṃ kiṃ maññatha, bhikkhave, katamaṃ nu kho bahutaraṃ – yo vāyaṃ mayā paritto nakhasikhāyaṃ paṃsu āropito, ayaṃ vā mahāpathavī’’ti? ‘‘Etadeva, bhante, bahutaraṃ yadidaṃ – mahāpathavī; appamattakāyaṃ bhagavatā paritto nakhasikhāyaṃ paṃsu āropito. Saṅkhampi na upeti, upanidhampi na upeti, kalabhāgampi na upeti mahāpathaviṃ upanidhāya bhagavatā paritto nakhasikhāyaṃ paṃsu āropito’’ti. ‘‘Evameva kho, bhikkhave, ariyasāvakassa diṭṭhisampannassa puggalassa abhisametāvino etadeva bahutaraṃ dukkhaṃ yadidaṃ parikkhīṇaṃ pariyādinnaṃ; appamattakaṃ avasiṭṭhaṃ. Saṅkhampi na upeti, upanidhampi na upeti, kalabhāgampi na upeti purimaṃ dukkhakkhandhaṃ parikkhīṇaṃ pariyādinnaṃ upanidhāya yadidaṃ sattakkhattuparamatā; yo ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti…pe… ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti’’.

1121.Then the Blessed One, picking up a little dust on the tip of his fingernail, addressed the bhikkhus: "What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is more: the little dust I have picked up on the tip of my fingernail, or this great earth?""Venerable sir, this great earth is far more. The little dust that the Blessed One has picked up on the tip of his fingernail is insignificant. It does not come into a calculation, nor into a comparison, nor into a fraction when compared to the great earth.""Just so, bhikkhus, for a noble disciple accomplished in view, a person who has attained penetration, the suffering that has been worn away and exhausted is far more. What remains is insignificant. It does not come into a calculation, nor into a comparison, nor into a fraction when compared to the former mass of suffering that has been worn away and exhausted—that is, the suffering limited to at most seven more lives. For one who understands as it really is: ‘This is suffering’; for one who understands as it really is: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; for one who understands as it really is: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; for one who understands as it really is: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’"

‘‘Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yogo karaṇīyo…pe… ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yogo karaṇīyo’’ti. Paṭhamaṃ.

"Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to penetrate: ‘This is suffering’; an exertion should be made to penetrate: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; an exertion should be made to penetrate: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; an exertion should be made to penetrate: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’" This is the first.
