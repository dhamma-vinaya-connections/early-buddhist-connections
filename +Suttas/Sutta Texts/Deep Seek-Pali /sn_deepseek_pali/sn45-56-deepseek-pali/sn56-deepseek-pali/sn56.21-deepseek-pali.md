# SN 56.21 Paṭhamakoṭigāmasuttaṃ

## SN 56.21 The First Koṭigāma Discourse

1091. Ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā vajjīsu viharati koṭigāme. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘catunnaṃ, bhikkhave, ariyasaccānaṃ ananubodhā appaṭivedhā evamidaṃ dīghamaddhānaṃ sandhāvitaṃ saṃsaritaṃ mamañceva tumhākañca’’.

1091.At one time the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjians at Koṭigāma. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, it is because of not fully understanding, not penetrating, the four noble truths that this long course of wandering and transmigration has continued for me as well as for you.”

‘‘Katamesaṃ catunnaṃ? Dukkhassa, bhikkhave, ariyasaccassa ananubodhā appaṭivedhā evamidaṃ dīghamaddhānaṃ sandhāvitaṃ saṃsaritaṃ mamañceva tumhākañca. Dukkhasamudayassa ariyasaccassa…pe… dukkhanirodhassa ariyasaccassa…pe… dukkhanirodhagāminiyā paṭipadāya ariyasaccassa ananubodhā appaṭivedhā evamidaṃ dīghamaddhānaṃ sandhāvitaṃ saṃsaritaṃ mamañceva tumhākañca. Tayidaṃ, bhikkhave, dukkhaṃ ariyasaccaṃ anubuddhaṃ paṭividdhaṃ, dukkhasamudayaṃ ariyasaccaṃ anubuddhaṃ paṭividdhaṃ, dukkhanirodhaṃ ariyasaccaṃ anubuddhaṃ paṭividdhaṃ, dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā ariyasaccaṃ anubuddhaṃ paṭividdhaṃ; ucchinnā bhavataṇhā, khīṇā bhavanetti; natthidāni punabbhavo’’ti.

“Which four? Because, bhikkhus, of not fully understanding, not penetrating, the noble truth of suffering, this long course of wandering and transmigration has continued for me as well as for you. Because of not fully understanding, not penetrating, the noble truth of the origin of suffering… Because of not fully understanding, not penetrating, the noble truth of the cessation of suffering… Because of not fully understanding, not penetrating, the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering, this long course of wandering and transmigration has continued for me as well as for you. But now, bhikkhus, the noble truth of suffering has been fully understood and penetrated, the noble truth of the origin of suffering has been fully understood and penetrated, the noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been fully understood and penetrated, the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering has been fully understood and penetrated; craving for existence has been cut off, the guide to becoming has been destroyed; now there is no more renewed existence.”

Idamavoca bhagavā. Idaṃ vatvāna sugato athāparaṃ etadavoca satthā –

The Blessed One said this. Having said this, the Well Gone One, the Teacher, then said further:

‘‘Catunnaṃ ariyasaccānaṃ, yathābhūtaṃ adassanā;Saṃsitaṃ [saṃsaritaṃ (syā. kaṃ. ka.) dī. ni. 2.155] dīghamaddhānaṃ, tāsu tāsveva jātisu.

Not seeing the Four Noble Truths as they actually are,One has wandered through a long course,In those very births.

‘‘Tāni [yāni (syā. kaṃ. pī. ka.)] etāni diṭṭhāni, bhavanetti samūhatā;Ucchinnaṃ mūlaṃ dukkhassa, natthidāni punabbhavo’’ti. paṭhamaṃ;

“These have been seen, the guide to becoming has been uprooted;The root of suffering has been cut off, now there is no more re-becoming.”First.
