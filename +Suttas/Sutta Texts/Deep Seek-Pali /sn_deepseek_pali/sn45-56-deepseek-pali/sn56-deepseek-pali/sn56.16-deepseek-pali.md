# SN 56.16 Dutiyadhāraṇasuttaṃ

## SN 56.16 The Second Discourse on Retention

1086. ‘‘Dhāretha no tumhe, bhikkhave, mayā cattāri ariyasaccāni desitānī’’ti? Evaṃ vutte aññataro bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘ahaṃ kho, bhante, dhāremi bhagavatā cattāri ariyasaccāni desitānī’’ti.

1086."Monks, do you retain the four Noble Truths taught by me?" When this was said, a certain monk said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, I retain the four Noble Truths taught by the Blessed One."

‘‘Yathā kathaṃ pana tvaṃ, bhikkhu, dhāresi mayā cattāri ariyasaccāni desitānī’’ti? ‘‘Dukkhaṃ khvāhaṃ, bhante, bhagavatā paṭhamaṃ ariyasaccaṃ desitaṃ dhāremi. Yo hi koci, bhante, samaṇo vā brāhmaṇo vā evaṃ vadeyya – ‘netaṃ dukkhaṃ paṭhamaṃ ariyasaccaṃ yaṃ samaṇena gotamena desitaṃ. Ahametaṃ dukkhaṃ paṭhamaṃ ariyasaccaṃ paccakkhāya aññaṃ dukkhaṃ paṭhamaṃ ariyasaccaṃ paññapessāmī’ti – netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati. Dukkhasamudayaṃ khvāhaṃ, bhante, bhagavatā…pe… dukkhanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ khvāhaṃ, bhante, bhagavatā catutthaṃ ariyasaccaṃ desitaṃ dhāremi. Yo hi koci, bhante, samaṇo vā brāhmaṇo vā evaṃ vadeyya – ‘netaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā catutthaṃ ariyasaccaṃ yaṃ samaṇena gotamena desitaṃ. Ahametaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ catutthaṃ ariyasaccaṃ paccakkhāya aññaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ catutthaṃ ariyasaccaṃ paññapessāmī’ti – netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati. Evaṃ khvāhaṃ, bhante, dhāremi bhagavatā cattāri ariyasaccāni desitānī’’ti.

"But how, monk, do you retain the four Noble Truths as taught by me?" "Venerable sir, I retain the first Noble Truth, suffering, as taught by the Blessed One. For, venerable sir, if any ascetic or brahmin were to say: ‘This is not the first Noble Truth, suffering, as taught by the ascetic Gotama. Rejecting this first Noble Truth, suffering, I will proclaim another first Noble Truth, suffering’—such a thing is impossible. Venerable sir, I retain the second Noble Truth, the origin of suffering, as taught by the Blessed One… I retain the fourth Noble Truth, the path leading to the cessation of suffering, as taught by the Blessed One. For, venerable sir, if any ascetic or brahmin were to say: ‘This is not the fourth Noble Truth, the path leading to the cessation of suffering, as taught by the ascetic Gotama. Rejecting this fourth Noble Truth, the path leading to the cessation of suffering, I will proclaim another fourth Noble Truth, the path leading to the cessation of suffering’—such a thing is impossible. Thus, venerable sir, I retain the four Noble Truths as taught by the Blessed One."

‘‘Sādhu sādhu, bhikkhu! Sādhu kho tvaṃ, bhikkhu, dhāresi mayā cattāri ariyasaccāni desitānīti. Dukkhaṃ kho, bhikkhu, mayā paṭhamaṃ ariyasaccaṃ desitaṃ, tathā naṃ dhārehi. Yo hi koci, bhikkhu, samaṇo vā brāhmaṇo vā evaṃ vadeyya – ‘netaṃ dukkhaṃ paṭhamaṃ ariyasaccaṃ yaṃ samaṇena gotamena desitaṃ. Ahametaṃ dukkhaṃ paṭhamaṃ ariyasaccaṃ paccakkhāya aññaṃ dukkhaṃ paṭhamaṃ ariyasaccaṃ paññapessāmī’ti – netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati. Dukkhasamudayaṃ kho, bhikkhu…pe… dukkhanirodhaṃ kho, bhikkhu…pe… dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā kho, bhikkhu, mayā catutthaṃ ariyasaccaṃ desitaṃ, tathā naṃ dhārehi. Yo hi koci, bhikkhu, samaṇo vā brāhmaṇo vā evaṃ vadeyya – ‘netaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā catutthaṃ ariyasaccaṃ yaṃ samaṇena gotamena desitaṃ. Ahametaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ catutthaṃ ariyasaccaṃ paccakkhāya aññaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ catutthaṃ ariyasaccaṃ paññapessāmī’ti – netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati. Evaṃ kho tvaṃ, bhikkhu, dhārehi mayā cattāri ariyasaccāni desitānīti.

"Good, good, bhikkhu! It is good that you, bhikkhu, retain the four Noble Truths as taught by me. Indeed, bhikkhu, suffering as the first Noble Truth was taught by me; retain it as such. If any ascetic or brahmin were to say, ‘This is not the first Noble Truth of suffering as taught by the ascetic Gotama. I reject this first Noble Truth of suffering and will declare another first Noble Truth of suffering’—such a thing is impossible. The origin of suffering, bhikkhu… The cessation of suffering, bhikkhu… The path leading to the cessation of suffering, bhikkhu, as the fourth Noble Truth was taught by me; retain it as such. If any ascetic or brahmin were to say, ‘This is not the fourth Noble Truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering as taught by the ascetic Gotama. I reject this fourth Noble Truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering and will declare another fourth Noble Truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering’—such a thing is impossible. Thus, bhikkhu, you should retain the four Noble Truths as taught by me."

‘‘Tasmātiha, bhikkhu, ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yogo karaṇīyo…pe… ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yogo karaṇīyo’’ti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

"Therefore, bhikkhu, effort should be made: ‘This is suffering’…effort should be made: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’" Sixth.
