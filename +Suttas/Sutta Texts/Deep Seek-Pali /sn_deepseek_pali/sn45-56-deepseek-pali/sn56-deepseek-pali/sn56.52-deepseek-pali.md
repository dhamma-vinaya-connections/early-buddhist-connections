# SN 56.52 Pokkharaṇīsuttaṃ

## SN 56.52 The Pokkharaṇī Discourse

1122. ‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, pokkharaṇī paññāsayojanāni āyāmena, paññāsayojanāni vitthārena, paññāsayojanāni ubbedhena, puṇṇā udakassa samatittikā kākapeyyā. Tato puriso kusaggena udakaṃ uddhareyya. Taṃ kiṃ maññatha, bhikkhave, katamaṃ nu kho bahutaraṃ – yaṃ vā kusaggena ubbhataṃ, yaṃ vā pokkharaṇiyā udaka’’nti? ‘‘Etadeva, bhante, bahutaraṃ, yadidaṃ – pokkharaṇiyā udakaṃ; appamattakaṃ kusaggena udakaṃ ubbhataṃ. Saṅkhampi na upeti, upanidhampi na upeti, kalabhāgampi na upeti pokkharaṇiyā udakaṃ upanidhāya kusaggena udakaṃ ubbhata’’nti. ‘‘Evameva kho, bhikkhave, ariyasāvakassa…pe… yogo karaṇīyo’’ti. Dutiyaṃ.

1122."Suppose, bhikkhus, there were a pond fifty yojanas long, fifty yojanas wide, and fifty yojanas deep, filled to the brim with water, enough for a crow to drink from. Then a man were to draw up water from it with the tip of a blade of kusa grass. What do you think, bhikkhus, which is more: the water drawn up with the tip of the blade of kusa grass or the water in the pond?""Venerable sir, the water in the pond is far more; the water drawn up with the tip of the blade of kusa grass is insignificant. It does not come into a calculation, nor into a comparison, nor into a fraction when compared to the water in the pond.""Just so, bhikkhus, for a noble disciple accomplished in view, a person who has attained penetration, that suffering which has been worn away and exhausted is far greater. What remains is insignificant. It does not come into a calculation, nor into a comparison, nor into a fraction when compared to the former mass of suffering that has been worn away and exhausted, in relation to the fact of becoming subject to at most seven more lives. For one who understands as it really is: ‘This is suffering’; for one who understands as it really is: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; for one who understands as it really is: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; for one who understands as it really is: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’" This is the second.
