# SN 56.50 Dutiyasinerupabbatarājasuttaṃ

## SN 56.50 The Second Discourse on Sineru, the King of Mountains.

1120. ‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, sinerupabbatarājāyaṃ parikkhayaṃ pariyādānaṃ gaccheyya, ṭhapetvā satta muggamattiyo pāsāṇasakkharā. Taṃ kiṃ maññatha, bhikkhave, katamaṃ nu kho bahutaraṃ – yaṃ vā sinerussa pabbatarājassa parikkhīṇaṃ pariyādinnaṃ, yā vā satta muggamattiyo pāsāṇasakkharā avasiṭṭhā’’ti? ‘‘Etadeva, bhante, bahutaraṃ sinerussa pabbatarājassa yadidaṃ parikkhīṇaṃ pariyādinnaṃ; appamattikā satta muggamattiyo pāsāṇasakkharā avasiṭṭhā. Saṅkhampi na upenti, upanidhampi na upenti, kalabhāgampi na upenti sinerussa pabbatarājassa parikkhīṇaṃ pariyādinnaṃ upanidhāya satta muggamattiyo pāsāṇasakkharā avasiṭṭhā’’ti. ‘‘Evameva kho, bhikkhave, ariyasāvakassa diṭṭhisampannassa puggalassa abhisametāvino etadeva bahutaraṃ dukkhaṃ yadidaṃ parikkhīṇaṃ pariyādinnaṃ; appamattakaṃ avasiṭṭhaṃ. Saṅkhampi na upeti, upanidhampi na upeti, kalabhāgampi na upeti, purimaṃ dukkhakkhandhaṃ parikkhīṇaṃ pariyādinnaṃ upanidhāya yadidaṃ sattakkhattuparamatā; yo ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti…pe… ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti’’.

1120."Suppose, bhikkhus, Sineru, the king of mountains, were to undergo wearing away and exhaustion, leaving only seven mustard seed-sized stone fragments. What do you think, bhikkhus, which is more: that which has been worn away and exhausted from Sineru, the king of mountains, or the seven mustard seed-sized stone fragments that remain?""Venerable sir, that which has been worn away and exhausted from Sineru, the king of mountains, is far greater. The seven mustard seed-sized stone fragments that remain are insignificant. They do not come into a calculation, nor into a comparison, nor into a fraction when compared to that which has been worn away and exhausted from Sineru, the king of mountains.""Just so, bhikkhus, for a noble disciple accomplished in view, a person who has attained penetration, that suffering which has been worn away and exhausted is far greater. What remains is insignificant. It does not come into a calculation, nor into a comparison, nor into a fraction when compared to the former mass of suffering that has been worn away and exhausted, in relation to the fact of becoming subject to at most seven more lives. For one who understands as it really is: ‘This is suffering’; for one who understands as it really is: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; for one who understands as it really is: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; for one who understands as it really is: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’"

‘‘Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yogo karaṇīyo…pe… ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yogo karaṇīyo’’ti. Dasamaṃ.

"Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to penetrate: ‘This is suffering’; an exertion should be made to penetrate: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; an exertion should be made to penetrate: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; an exertion should be made to penetrate: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’" This is the tenth.
