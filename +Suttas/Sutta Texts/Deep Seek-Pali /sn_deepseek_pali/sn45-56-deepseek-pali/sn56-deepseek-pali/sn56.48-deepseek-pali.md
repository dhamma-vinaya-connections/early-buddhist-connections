## SN 56.48 The Second Discourse on the Yoke with a Hole

1118. ‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, ayaṃ mahāpathavī ekodakā assa. Tatra puriso ekacchiggaḷaṃ yugaṃ pakkhipeyya. Tamenaṃ puratthimo vāto pacchimena saṃhareyya, pacchimo vāto puratthimena saṃhareyya, uttaro vāto dakkhiṇena saṃhareyya, dakkhiṇo vāto uttarena saṃhareyya. Tatrassa kāṇo kacchapo. So vassasatassa vassasatassa accayena sakiṃ sakiṃ ummujjeyya. Taṃ kiṃ maññatha, bhikkhave, api nu kho kāṇo kacchapo vassasatassa vassasatassa accayena sakiṃ sakiṃ ummujjanto amusmiṃ ekacchiggaḷe yuge gīvaṃ paveseyyā’’ti? ‘‘Adhiccamidaṃ, bhante, yaṃ so kāṇo kacchapo vassasatassa vassasatassa accayena sakiṃ sakiṃ ummujjanto amusmiṃ ekacchiggaḷe yuge gīvaṃ paveseyyā’’ti.

1118.“Monks, suppose this great earth were entirely covered with water, and a man were to throw a yoke with a single hole into it. The east wind would carry it west, the west wind would carry it east, the north wind would carry it south, and the south wind would carry it north. And there were a blind turtle. It would come up once every hundred years. What do you think, monks? Would that blind turtle, coming up once every hundred years, be able to insert its neck into that yoke with a single hole?” “It would be an exceedingly rare occurrence, Venerable sir, that the blind turtle, coming up once every hundred years, would insert its neck into that yoke with a single hole.”

‘‘Evaṃ adhiccamidaṃ, bhikkhave, yaṃ manussattaṃ labhati. Evaṃ adhiccamidaṃ, bhikkhave, yaṃ tathāgato loke uppajjati arahaṃ sammāsambuddho. Evaṃ adhiccamidaṃ, bhikkhave, yaṃ tathāgatappavedito dhammavinayo loke dibbati. Tassidaṃ [tayidaṃ (?)], bhikkhave, manussattaṃ laddhaṃ, tathāgato loke uppanno arahaṃ sammāsambuddho, tathāgatappavedito ca dhammavinayo loke dibbati.

“So too, monks, it is an exceedingly rare occurrence that one obtains human birth. So too, monks, it is an exceedingly rare occurrence that a Tathagata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, arises in the world. So too, monks, it is an exceedingly rare occurrence that the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata shines in the world. This human birth, monks, has been obtained; a Tathagata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Self-Enlightened One, has arisen in the world; and the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata shines in the world.

‘‘Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yogo karaṇīyo…pe… ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yogo karaṇīyo’’ti. Aṭṭhamaṃ.

“Therefore, monks, an exertion should be made to realize: ‘This is suffering’… an exertion should be made to realize: ‘This is the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’” The eighth.
