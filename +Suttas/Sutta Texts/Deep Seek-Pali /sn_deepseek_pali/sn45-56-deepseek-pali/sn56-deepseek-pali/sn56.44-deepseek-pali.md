# SN 56.44 Kūṭāgārasuttaṃ

## SN 56.44 The Discourse on the Gabled House

1114. ‘‘Yo hi, bhikkhave [yo ca kho bhikkhave (syā. ka.)], evaṃ vadeyya – ‘ahaṃ dukkhaṃ ariyasaccaṃ yathābhūtaṃ anabhisamecca…pe… dukkhanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ ariyasaccaṃ yathābhūtaṃ anabhisamecca sammā dukkhassantaṃ karissāmī’ti – netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati.

1114.Monks, if anyone should say this: ‘Without fully understanding the noble truth of suffering as it really is… without fully understanding the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering as it really is, I will rightly make an end to suffering’—that is not possible.

‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, yo evaṃ vadeyya – ‘ahaṃ kūṭāgārassa heṭṭhimaṃ gharaṃ akaritvā uparimaṃ gharaṃ āropessāmī’ti – netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati; evameva kho, bhikkhave, yo evaṃ vadeyya – ‘ahaṃ dukkhaṃ ariyasaccaṃ yathābhūtaṃ anabhisamecca…pe… dukkhanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ ariyasaccaṃ yathābhūtaṃ anabhisamecca sammā dukkhassantaṃ karissāmī’ti – netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati.

Just as, monks, if someone were to say, ‘Without building the lower story of a gabled house, I will raise the upper story’—that is not possible; in the same way, monks, if someone were to say, ‘Without fully understanding the noble truth of suffering as it really is… without fully understanding the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering as it really is, I will rightly make an end to suffering’—that is not possible.

‘‘Yo ca kho, bhikkhave, evaṃ vadeyya – ‘ahaṃ dukkhaṃ ariyasaccaṃ yathābhūtaṃ abhisamecca…pe… dukkhanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ ariyasaccaṃ yathābhūtaṃ abhisamecca sammā dukkhassantaṃ karissāmī’ti – ṭhānametaṃ vijjati.

Monks, if anyone should say this: ‘Having directly known the noble truth of suffering as it really is… having directly known the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering as it really is, I shall rightly make an end to suffering’—this is indeed possible.

‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, yo evaṃ vadeyya – ‘ahaṃ kūṭāgārassa heṭṭhimaṃ gharaṃ karitvā uparimaṃ gharaṃ āropessāmī’ti – ṭhānametaṃ vijjati; evameva kho, bhikkhave, yo evaṃ vadeyya – ‘ahaṃ dukkhaṃ ariyasaccaṃ yathābhūtaṃ abhisamecca…pe… dukkhanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ ariyasaccaṃ yathābhūtaṃ abhisamecca sammā dukkhassantaṃ karissāmī’ti – ṭhānametaṃ vijjati.

Just as, monks, if someone were to say, ‘Having built the lower story of a gabled house, I will then erect the upper story’—this is indeed possible; in the same way, monks, if someone were to say, ‘Having directly known the noble truth of suffering as it really is… having directly known the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering as it really is, I will rightly make an end to suffering’—this is indeed possible.

‘‘Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yogo karaṇīyo…pe… ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yogo karaṇīyo’’ti. Catutthaṃ.

Therefore, monks, effort should be made to realize: ‘This is suffering’… effort should be made to realize: ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’
