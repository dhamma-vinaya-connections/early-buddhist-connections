# SN 56.14 Ajjhattikāyatanasuttaṃ

## SN 56.14 The Sutta on the Internal Sense Bases

1084. ‘‘Cattārimāni, bhikkhave, ariyasaccāni. Katamāni cattāri? Dukkhaṃ ariyasaccaṃ, dukkhasamudayaṃ ariyasaccaṃ, dukkhanirodhaṃ ariyasaccaṃ, dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā ariyasaccaṃ.

1084.Monks, these are the four noble truths. What four? The noble truth of suffering, the noble truth of the origin of suffering, the noble truth of the cessation of suffering, the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering.

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, dukkhaṃ ariyasaccaṃ? ‘Cha ajjhattikāni āyatanānī’ tissa vacanīyaṃ. Katamāni cha? Cakkhāyatanaṃ…pe… manāyatanaṃ – idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, dukkhaṃ ariyasaccaṃ.

And what, monks, is the noble truth of suffering? It should be said: the six internal sense bases. What six? The eye sense base… the mind sense base. This, monks, is called the noble truth of suffering.

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, dukkhasamudayaṃ ariyasaccaṃ? Yāyaṃ taṇhā ponobbhavikā nandirāgasahagatā tatratatrābhinandinī, seyyathidaṃ – kāmataṇhā, bhavataṇhā, vibhavataṇhā – idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, dukkhasamudayaṃ ariyasaccaṃ.

And what, monks, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering? It is this craving that leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking pleasure here and there; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, and craving for non-existence. This, monks, is called the noble truth of the origin of suffering.

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, dukkhanirodhaṃ ariyasaccaṃ? Yo tassāyeva taṇhāya asesavirāganirodho cāgo paṭinissaggo mutti anālayo – idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, dukkhanirodhaṃ ariyasaccaṃ.

And what, monks, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering? It is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that very craving, its abandonment, relinquishment, release, and non-attachment. This, monks, is called the noble truth of the cessation of suffering.

‘‘Katamañca, bhikkhave, dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā ariyasaccaṃ? Ayameva ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo, seyyathidaṃ – sammādiṭṭhi…pe… sammāsamādhi – idaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā ariyasaccaṃ. Imāni kho, bhikkhave, cattāri ariyasaccāni.

And what, monks, is the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering? It is simply this Noble Eightfold Path, that is: right view…right concentration. This, monks, is called the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering. These, monks, are the four noble truths.

‘‘Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, ‘idaṃ dukkha’nti yogo karaṇīyo…pe… ‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yogo karaṇīyo’’ti. Catutthaṃ.

Therefore, monks, effort should be made to realize: 'This is suffering.' ... 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.' This is the fourth.
