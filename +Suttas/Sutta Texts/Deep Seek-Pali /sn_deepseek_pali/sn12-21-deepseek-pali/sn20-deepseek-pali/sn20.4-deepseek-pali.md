# SN 20.4 Okkhāsuttaṃ

## SN 20.4 The Discourse on Cauldrons

226. Sāvatthiyaṃ viharati…pe… ‘‘yo, bhikkhave, pubbaṇhasamayaṃ okkhāsataṃ dānaṃ dadeyya, yo majjhanhikasamayaṃ okkhāsataṃ dānaṃ dadeyya, yo sāyanhasamayaṃ okkhāsataṃ dānaṃ dadeyya, yo vā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ antamaso gadduhanamattampi mettacittaṃ bhāveyya, yo vā majjhanhikasamayaṃ antamaso gadduhanamattampi mettacittaṃ bhāveyya, yo vā sāyanhasamayaṃ antamaso gadduhanamattampi mettacittaṃ bhāveyya, idaṃ tato mahapphalataraṃ. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, evaṃ sikkhitabbaṃ – ‘mettā no cetovimutti bhāvitā bhavissati bahulīkatā yānīkatā vatthukatā anuṭṭhitā paricitā susamāraddhā’ti. Evañhi vo, bhikkhave, sikkhitabba’’nti. Catutthaṃ.

226.At Sāvatthī. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, if someone were to give a gift of a hundred large cauldrons [of food] in the morning, if someone were to give a gift of a hundred large cauldrons at noon, if someone were to give a gift of a hundred large cauldrons in the evening; or if someone were to develop a mind of loving-kindness, even for the time it takes to milk a cow, in the morning, or if someone were to develop a mind of loving-kindness, even for the time it takes to milk a cow, at noon, or if someone were to develop a mind of loving-kindness, even for the time it takes to milk a cow, in the evening—this would be far more fruitful than that. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘Our liberation of mind by loving-kindness will be developed, cultivated, made a vehicle, made a basis, established, practiced, and well undertaken.’ Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves.” The Fourth.
