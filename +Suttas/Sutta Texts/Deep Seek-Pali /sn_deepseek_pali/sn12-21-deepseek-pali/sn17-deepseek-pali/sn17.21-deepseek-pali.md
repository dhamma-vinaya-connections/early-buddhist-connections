## SN 17.21 The Rope Discourse

178. Sāvatthiyaṃ viharati…pe… ‘‘dāruṇo, bhikkhave, lābhasakkārasiloko. Lābhasakkārasiloko, bhikkhave, chaviṃ chindati, chaviṃ chetvā cammaṃ chindati, cammaṃ chetvā maṃsaṃ chindati, maṃsaṃ chetvā nhāruṃ chindati, nhāruṃ chetvā aṭṭhiṃ chindati, aṭṭhiṃ chetvā aṭṭhimiñjaṃ āhacca tiṭṭhati’’.

178.At Sāvatthī the Blessed One was dwelling… “Fierce, bhikkhus, are gain, honor, and renown. Gain, honor, and renown, bhikkhus, cut through the skin; having cut through the skin, they cut through the hide; having cut through the hide, they cut through the flesh; having cut through the flesh, they cut through the sinew; having cut through the sinew, they cut through the bone; having cut through the bone, they penetrate to the bone marrow and remain there.”

‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, balavā puriso daḷhāya vāḷarajjuyā jaṅghaṃ veṭhetvā ghaṃseyya. Sā chaviṃ chindeyya, chaviṃ chetvā cammaṃ chindeyya, cammaṃ chetvā maṃsaṃ chindeyya, maṃsaṃ chetvā nhāruṃ chindeyya, nhāruṃ chetvā aṭṭhiṃ chindeyya, aṭṭhiṃ chetvā aṭṭhimiñjaṃ āhacca tiṭṭheyya. Evameva kho, bhikkhave, lābhasakkārasiloko chaviṃ chindati, chaviṃ chetvā cammaṃ chindati, cammaṃ chetvā maṃsaṃ chindati, maṃsaṃ chetvā nhāruṃ chindati, nhāruṃ chetvā aṭṭhiṃ chindati, aṭṭhiṃ chetvā aṭṭhiṃmiñjaṃ āhacca tiṭṭhati. Evaṃ dāruṇo kho, bhikkhave, lābhasakkārasiloko…pe… evañhi vo, bhikkhave, sikkhitabba’’nti. Navamaṃ.

“Suppose, bhikkhus, a strong man were to bind a coarse rope around your leg and chafe it. That would cut through the skin; having cut through the skin, it would cut through the hide; having cut through the hide, it would cut through the flesh; having cut through the flesh, it would cut through the sinews; having cut through the sinews, it would cut through the bone; having cut through the bone, it would penetrate to the bone marrow and remain there. In the same way, bhikkhus, gain, honor, and renown cut through the skin; having cut through the skin, they cut through the hide; having cut through the hide, they cut through the flesh; having cut through the flesh, they cut through the sinews; having cut through the sinews, they cut through the bone; having cut through the bone, they penetrate to the bone marrow and remain there. Such is the fierceness, bhikkhus, of gain, honor, and renown… Thus, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves.” The ninth.
