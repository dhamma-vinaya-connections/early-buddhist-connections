# SN 16.5 Jiṇṇasuttaṃ

## SN 16.5 The Old Discourse

148. Evaṃ me sutaṃ…pe… rājagahe veḷuvane. Atha kho āyasmā mahākassapo yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ kho āyasmantaṃ mahākassapaṃ bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘jiṇṇosi dāni tvaṃ, kassapa, garukāni ca te imāni sāṇāni paṃsukūlāni nibbasanāni. Tasmātiha tvaṃ, kassapa, gahapatāni [gahapatikāni (sī.)] ceva cīvarāni dhārehi, nimantanāni ca bhuñjāhi, mama ca santike viharāhī’’ti.

148.Thus have I heard – At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove. Then the Venerable Mahākassapa approached the Blessed One; having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. As he was sitting to one side, the Blessed One said to the Venerable Mahākassapa: "Kassapa, you are now old, and these hempen rag-robes are heavy for you. Therefore, Kassapa, wear robes given by householders, accept invitations, and live near me."

‘‘Ahaṃ kho, bhante, dīgharattaṃ āraññiko ceva āraññikattassa ca vaṇṇavādī, piṇḍapātiko ceva piṇḍapātikattassa ca vaṇṇavādī, paṃsukūliko ceva paṃsukūlikattassa ca vaṇṇavādī, tecīvariko ceva tecīvarikattassa ca vaṇṇavādī, appiccho ceva appicchatāya ca vaṇṇavādī, santuṭṭho ceva santuṭṭhiyā ca vaṇṇavādī, pavivitto ceva pavivekassa ca vaṇṇavādī, asaṃsaṭṭho ceva asaṃsaggassa ca vaṇṇavādī, āraddhavīriyo ceva vīriyārambhassa [vīriyārabbhassa (ka.)] ca vaṇṇavādī’’ti.

"Venerable sir, for a long time I have been a forest-dweller and one who speaks in praise of forest-dwelling, an alms-seeker and one who speaks in praise of alms-seeking, a rag-robe wearer and one who speaks in praise of rag-robes, one who has only three robes and one who speaks in praise of having three robes, one of few desires and one who speaks in praise of fewness of desires, content and one who speaks in praise of contentment, secluded and one who speaks in praise of seclusion, detached and one who speaks in praise of detachment, energetic and one who speaks in praise of the instigation of energy."

‘‘Kiṃ [kaṃ (ka.)] pana tvaṃ, kassapa, atthavasaṃ sampassamāno dīgharattaṃ āraññiko ceva āraññikattassa ca vaṇṇavādī, piṇḍapātiko ceva…pe… paṃsukūliko ceva… tecīvariko ceva… appiccho ceva… santuṭṭho ceva… pavivitto ceva… asaṃsaṭṭho ceva… āraddhavīriyo ceva vīriyārambhassa ca vaṇṇavādī’’ti?

"But, Kassapa, seeing what benefit have you for a long time been a forest-dweller and one who speaks in praise of forest-dwelling, an alms-seeker and one who speaks in praise of alms-seeking, a rag-robe wearer and one who speaks in praise of rag-robes, one who has only three robes and one who speaks in praise of having three robes, one of few desires and one who speaks in praise of fewness of desires, content and one who speaks in praise of contentment, secluded and one who speaks in praise of seclusion, detached and one who speaks in praise of detachment, energetic and one who speaks in praise of the instigation of energy?"

‘‘Dve khvāhaṃ, bhante, atthavase sampassamāno dīgharattaṃ āraññiko ceva āraññikattassa ca vaṇṇavādī, piṇḍapātiko ceva…pe… paṃsukūliko ceva… tecīvariko ceva… appiccho ceva… santuṭṭho ceva… pavivitto ceva… asaṃsaṭṭho ceva… āraddhavīriyo ceva vīriyārambhassa ca vaṇṇavādī. Attano ca diṭṭhadhammasukhavihāraṃ sampassamāno, pacchimañca janataṃ anukampamāno – ‘appeva nāma pacchimā janatā diṭṭhānugatiṃ āpajjeyyuṃ’ [āpajjeyya (sī. syā. kaṃ.)]. ‘Ye kira te ahesuṃ buddhānubuddhasāvakā te dīgharattaṃ āraññikā ceva ahesuṃ āraññikattassa ca vaṇṇavādino…pe… piṇḍapātikā ceva ahesuṃ …pe… paṃsukūlikā ceva ahesuṃ… tecīvarikā ceva ahesuṃ… appicchā ceva ahesuṃ… santuṭṭhā ceva ahesuṃ… pavivittā ceva ahesuṃ… asaṃsaṭṭhā ceva ahesuṃ… āraddhavīriyā ceva ahesuṃ vīriyārambhassa ca vaṇṇavādino’ti. Te tathattāya paṭipajjissanti, tesaṃ taṃ bhavissati dīgharattaṃ hitāya sukhāya.

"Venerable sir, I see two benefits in having for a long time been a forest-dweller and one who speaks in praise of forest-dwelling, an alms-seeker and one who speaks in praise of alms-seeking, a rag-robe wearer and one who speaks in praise of rag-robes, one who has only three robes and one who speaks in praise of having three robes, one of few desires and one who speaks in praise of fewness of desires, content and one who speaks in praise of contentment, secluded and one who speaks in praise of seclusion, detached and one who speaks in praise of detachment, energetic and one who speaks in praise of the instigation of energy. Seeing my own abiding in happiness in this very life, and being compassionate towards future generations—‘Perhaps future generations will undertake following this example.’ ‘Those disciples who were enlightened after the Buddha spent for a long time being forest-dwellers and spoke in praise of forest-dwelling, were alms-seekers and spoke in praise of alms-seeking, were rag-robe wearers and spoke in praise of rag-robes, were ones who had only three robes and spoke in praise of having three robes, were ones of few desires and spoke in praise of fewness of desires, were content and spoke in praise of contentment, were secluded and spoke in praise of seclusion, were detached and spoke in praise of detachment, were energetic and spoke in praise of the instigation of energy.’ They will practice accordingly, and that will be for their long-term welfare and happiness."

‘‘Ime khvāhaṃ, bhante, dve atthavase sampassamāno dīgharattaṃ āraññiko ceva āraññikattassa ca vaṇṇavādī, piṇḍapātiko ceva…pe… paṃsukūliko ceva… tecīvariko ceva… appiccho ceva… santuṭṭho ceva… pavivitto ceva… asaṃsaṭṭho ceva… āraddhavīriyo ceva vīriyārambhassa ca vaṇṇavādī’’ti.

"Venerable sir, seeing these two benefits, I have for a long time been a forest-dweller and one who speaks in praise of forest-dwelling, an alms-seeker and one who speaks in praise of alms-seeking, a rag-robe wearer and one who speaks in praise of rag-robes, one who has only three robes and one who speaks in praise of having three robes, one of few desires and one who speaks in praise of fewness of desires, content and one who speaks in praise of contentment, secluded and one who speaks in praise of seclusion, detached and one who speaks in praise of detachment, energetic and one who speaks in praise of the instigation of energy."

‘‘Sādhu sādhu, kassapa. Bahujanahitāya kira tvaṃ, kassapa, paṭipanno bahujanasukhāya lokānukampāya atthāya hitāya sukhāya devamanussānaṃ. Tasmātiha tvaṃ, kassapa, sāṇāni ceva paṃsukūlāni dhārehi nibbasanāni, piṇḍāya ca carāhi, araññe ca viharāhī’’ti. Pañcamaṃ.

"Good, good, Kassapa. Indeed, Kassapa, you have undertaken [this path] for the welfare of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. Therefore, Kassapa, wear hempen rag-robes, go for alms, and live in the forest."
