## SN 16.4 The Discourse on Frequenting Families

147. Sāvatthiyaṃ viharati…pe… ‘‘taṃ kiṃ maññatha, bhikkhave, kathaṃrūpo bhikkhu arahati kulūpako hotuṃ, kathaṃrūpo bhikkhu na arahati kulūpako hotu’’nti? Bhagavaṃmūlakā no, bhante, dhammā…pe… bhagavā etadavoca –

147.At Sāvatthī… “What do you think, bhikkhus, what sort of bhikkhu is fit to frequent families, and what sort is not?” “Bhante, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One…” The Blessed One said this:

‘‘Yo hi koci, bhikkhave, bhikkhu evaṃcitto kulāni upasaṅkamati – ‘dentuyeva me, mā nādaṃsu; bahukaññeva me dentu, mā thokaṃ; paṇītaññeva me dentu, mā lūkhaṃ; sīghaññeva me dentu, mā dandhaṃ; sakkaccaññeva me dentu, mā asakkacca’nti. Tassa ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno evaṃcittassa kulāni upasaṅkamato na denti, tena bhikkhu sandīyati; so tatonidānaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedayati. Thokaṃ denti, no bahukaṃ…pe… lūkhaṃ denti, no paṇītaṃ… dandhaṃ denti, no sīghaṃ, tena bhikkhu sandīyati; so tatonidānaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedayati. Asakkaccaṃ denti, no sakkaccaṃ; tena bhikkhu sandīyati; so tatonidānaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedayati. Evarūpo kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu na arahati kūlūpako hotuṃ.

“Bhikkhus, any bhikkhu who approaches families with such thoughts: ‘Let them give to me, may they not fail to give; let them give much to me, may they not give little; let them give fine things to me, may they not give coarse; let them give quickly to me, may they not give slowly; let them give respectfully to me, may they not give disrespectfully’—if, bhikkhus, when such a bhikkhu approaches families with such thoughts, they do not give, that bhikkhu is distressed; because of that, he experiences suffering and displeasure. If they give little, not much, that bhikkhu is distressed; because of that, he experiences suffering and displeasure. If they give coarse things, not fine, that bhikkhu is distressed; because of that, he experiences suffering and displeasure. If they give slowly, not quickly, that bhikkhu is distressed; because of that, he experiences suffering and displeasure. If they give disrespectfully, not respectfully, that bhikkhu is distressed; because of that, he experiences suffering and displeasure. Such a bhikkhu, bhikkhus, is not fit to frequent families.

‘‘Yo ca kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu evaṃcitto kulāni upasaṅkamati – ‘taṃ kutettha labbhā parakulesu – dentuyeva me, mā nādaṃsu; bahukaññeva me dentu, mā thokaṃ; paṇītaññeva me dentu, mā lūkhaṃ; dīghaññeva me dentu, mā dandhaṃ; sakkaccaññeva me dentu, mā asakkacca’nti. Tassa ce, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno evaṃcittassa kulāni upasaṅkamato na denti; tena bhikkhu na sandīyati; so na tatonidānaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedayati. Thokaṃ denti, no bahukaṃ; tena bhikkhu na sandīyati; so na tatonidānaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedayati. Lūkhaṃ denti, no paṇītaṃ; tena bhikkhu na sandīyati; so na tatonidānaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedayati. Dandhaṃ denti, no sīghaṃ; tena bhikkhu na sandīyati; so na tatonidānaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedayati. Asakkaccaṃ denti, no sakkaccaṃ; tena bhikkhu na sandīyati; so na tatonidānaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedayati. Evarūpo kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu arahati kulūpako hotuṃ.

“But, bhikkhus, any bhikkhu who approaches families with such thoughts: ‘What is to be obtained here among other families? Let them give to me, may they not fail to give; let them give much to me, may they not give little; let them give fine things to me, may they not give coarse; let them give quickly to me, may they not give slowly; let them give respectfully to me, may they not give disrespectfully’—if, bhikkhus, when such a bhikkhu approaches families with such thoughts, they do not give, that bhikkhu is not distressed; he does not, because of that, experience suffering and displeasure. If they give little, not much, that bhikkhu is not distressed; he does not, because of that, experience suffering and displeasure. If they give coarse things, not fine, that bhikkhu is not distressed; he does not, because of that, experience suffering and displeasure. If they give slowly, not quickly, that bhikkhu is not distressed; he does not, because of that, experience suffering and displeasure. If they give disrespectfully, not respectfully, that bhikkhu is not distressed; he does not, because of that, experience suffering and displeasure. Such a bhikkhu, bhikkhus, is fit to frequent families.”

‘‘Kassapo, bhikkhave, evaṃcitto kulāni upasaṅkamati – ‘taṃ kutettha labbhā parakulesu – dentuyeva me, mā nādaṃsu; bahukaññeva me dentu, mā thokaṃ; paṇītaññeva me dentu, mā lūkhaṃ; sīghaññeva me dentu, mā dandhaṃ; sakkaccaññeva me dentu, mā asakkacca’nti. Tassa ce, bhikkhave, kassapassa evaṃcittassa kulāni upasaṅkamato na denti; tena kassapo na sandīyati; so na tatonidānaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedayati. Thokaṃ denti, no bahukaṃ; tena kassapo na sandīyati; so na tatonidānaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedayati. Lūkhaṃ denti, no paṇītaṃ; tena kassapo na sandīyati; so na tatonidānaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedayati. Dandhaṃ denti, no sīghaṃ; tena kassapo na sandīyati; so na tatonidānaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedayati. Asakkaccaṃ denti, no sakkaccaṃ; tena kassapo na sandīyati; so na tatonidānaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedayati. Kassapena vā hi vo, bhikkhave, ovadissāmi yo vā panassa kassapasadiso. Ovaditehi ca pana vo tathattāya paṭipajjitabba’’nti. Catutthaṃ.

“Bhikkhus, when Kassapa approaches families, his mind is like this: ‘What is to be obtained here among other families? Let them give to me, may they not fail to give; let them give much to me, may they not give little; let them give fine things to me, may they not give coarse; let them give quickly to me, may they not give slowly; let them give respectfully to me, may they not give disrespectfully.’ But if, bhikkhus, when Kassapa approaches families with such a mind, they do not give, Kassapa is not distressed by that; he does not, because of that, experience suffering and displeasure. If they give little, not much, Kassapa is not distressed by that; he does not, because of that, experience suffering and displeasure. If they give coarse things, not fine, Kassapa is not distressed by that; he does not, because of that, experience suffering and displeasure. If they give slowly, not quickly, Kassapa is not distressed by that; he does not, because of that, experience suffering and displeasure. If they give disrespectfully, not respectfully, Kassapa is not distressed by that; he does not, because of that, experience suffering and displeasure. Bhikkhus, I shall advise you by means of Kassapa, or one who is like Kassapa. And having been exhorted, you should practice accordingly.” This is the fourth.
