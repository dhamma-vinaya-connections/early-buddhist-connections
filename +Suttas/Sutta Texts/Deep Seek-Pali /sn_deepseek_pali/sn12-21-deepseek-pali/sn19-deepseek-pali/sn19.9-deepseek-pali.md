# SN 19.9 Dutiyasūcilomasuttaṃ

## SN 19.9 The Second Needle-Haired Sutta

210. ‘‘Idhāhaṃ, āvuso, gijjhakūṭā pabbatā orohanto addasaṃ sūcilomaṃ purisaṃ vehāsaṃ gacchantaṃ. Tassa tā sūciyo sīse pavisitvā mukhato nikkhamanti; mukhe pavisitvā urato nikkhamanti; ure pavisitvā udarato nikkhamanti; udare pavisitvā ūrūhi nikkhamanti; ūrūsu pavisitvā jaṅghāhi nikkhamanti; jaṅghāsu pavisitvā pādehi nikkhamanti; so sudaṃ aṭṭassaraṃ karoti…pe… eso, bhikkhave, satto imasmiṃyeva rājagahe sūcako ahosi…pe…. Navamaṃ.

210."Friends, as I was descending from Vulture Peak Mountain, I saw a man with needle-hairs going through the air. Those needles entered his head and came out through his mouth; entered his mouth and came out through his chest; entered his chest and came out through his belly; entered his belly and came out through his thighs; entered his thighs and came out through his shins; entered his shins and came out through his feet. He was uttering a cry of agony… This being, monks, used to be an informer right here in Rājagaha… The ninth."
