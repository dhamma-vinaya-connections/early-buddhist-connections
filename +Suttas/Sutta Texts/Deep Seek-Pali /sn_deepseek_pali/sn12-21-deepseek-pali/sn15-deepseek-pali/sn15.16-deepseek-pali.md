## SN 15.16 The Brother Sutta

139. Sāvatthiyaṃ viharati…pe… ‘‘na so, bhikkhave, satto sulabharūpo yo nabhātābhūtapubbo…pe… alaṃ vimuccitu’’nti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

139.At Sāvatthī. “Monks, this saṃsāra is without discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving. Monks, a being is not easily found who has not previously been a brother in this long journey. Why is that? Monks, this saṃsāra is without discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving. For such a long time, monks, you have experienced suffering, intense suffering, and disaster, and the cemeteries have increased. Surely, monks, it is enough to become disenchanted with all conditioned things, enough to become dispassionate towards them, enough to be liberated from them.” The sixth.
