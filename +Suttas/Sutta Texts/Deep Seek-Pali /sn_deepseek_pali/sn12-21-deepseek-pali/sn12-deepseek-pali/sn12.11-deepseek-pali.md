## SN 12.11 The Discourse on Nutriments

11. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme…pe… etadavoca – ‘‘cattārome, bhikkhave, āhārā bhūtānaṃ vā sattānaṃ ṭhitiyā sambhavesīnaṃ vā anuggahāya. Katame cattāro? Kabaḷīkāro [kabaḷiṃkāro (sī. pī.), kavaḷīkāro (syā. kaṃ.)] āhāro – oḷāriko vā sukhumo vā, phasso dutiyo, manosañcetanā tatiyā, viññāṇaṃ catutthaṃ. Ime kho, bhikkhave, cattāro āhārā bhūtānaṃ vā sattānaṃ ṭhitiyā sambhavesīnaṃ vā anuggahāya’’.

11. Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. ... and he said this: "Monks, there are these four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have come to be and for the support of those seeking birth. Which four? Physical food, gross or subtle; contact as the second; mental volition as the third; and consciousness as the fourth. These, monks, are the four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have come to be and for the support of those seeking birth."

‘‘Ime, bhikkhave, cattāro āhārā kiṃnidānā kiṃsamudayā kiṃjātikā kiṃpabhavā? Ime cattāro āhārā taṇhānidānā taṇhāsamudayā taṇhājātikā taṇhāpabhavā. Taṇhā cāyaṃ, bhikkhave, kiṃnidānā kiṃsamudayā kiṃjātikā kiṃpabhavā? Taṇhā vedanānidānā vedanāsamudayā vedanājātikā vedanāpabhavā. Vedanā cāyaṃ, bhikkhave, kiṃnidānā kiṃsamudayā kiṃjātikā kiṃpabhavā? Vedanā phassanidānā phassasamudayā phassajātikā phassapabhavā. Phasso cāyaṃ, bhikkhave, kiṃnidāno kiṃsamudayo kiṃjātiko kiṃpabhavo? Phasso saḷāyatananidāno saḷāyatanasamudayo saḷāyatanajātiko saḷāyatanapabhavo. Saḷāyatanañcidaṃ, bhikkhave, kiṃnidānaṃ kiṃsamudayaṃ kiṃjātikaṃ kiṃpabhavaṃ? Saḷāyatanaṃ nāmarūpanidānaṃ nāmarūpasamudayaṃ nāmarūpajātikaṃ nāmarūpapabhavaṃ. Nāmarūpañcidaṃ, bhikkhave, kiṃnidānaṃ kiṃsamudayaṃ kiṃjātikaṃ kiṃpabhavaṃ? Nāmarūpaṃ viññāṇanidānaṃ viññāṇasamudayaṃ viññāṇajātikaṃ viññāṇapabhavaṃ. Viññāṇañcidaṃ, bhikkhave, kiṃnidānaṃ kiṃsamudayaṃ kiṃjātikaṃ kiṃpabhavaṃ? Viññāṇaṃ saṅkhāranidānaṃ saṅkhārasamudayaṃ saṅkhārajātikaṃ saṅkhārapabhavaṃ. Saṅkhārā cime, bhikkhave, kiṃnidānā kiṃsamudayā kiṃjātikā kiṃpabhavā? Saṅkhārā avijjānidānā avijjāsamudayā avijjājātikā avijjāpabhavā.

"Monks, what is the source of these four nutriments, what is their origin, what is their birth, what is their arising? These four nutriments have craving as their source, craving as their origin, they are born from craving, they arise from craving. And what is the source of this craving, monks, what is its origin, what is its birth, what is its arising? Craving has feeling as its source, feeling as its origin, it is born from feeling, it arises from feeling. And what is the source of this feeling, monks, what is its origin, what is its birth, what is its arising? Feeling has contact as its source, contact as its origin, it is born from contact, it arises from contact. And what is the source of this contact, monks, what is its origin, what is its birth, what is its arising? Contact has the six sense bases as its source, the six sense bases as its origin, it is born from the six sense bases, it arises from the six sense bases. And what is the source of these six sense bases, monks, what is their origin, what is their birth, what is their arising? The six sense bases have name-and-form as their source, name-and-form as their origin, they are born from name-and-form, they arise from name-and-form. And what is the source of this name-and-form, monks, what is its origin, what is its birth, what is its arising? Name-and-form has consciousness as its source, consciousness as its origin, it is born from consciousness, it arises from consciousness. And what is the source of this consciousness, monks, what is its origin, what is its birth, what is its arising? Consciousness has volitional formations as its source, volitional formations as its origin, it is born from volitional formations, it arises from volitional formations. And what is the source of these volitional formations, monks, what is their origin, what is their birth, what is their arising? Volitional formations have ignorance as their source, ignorance as their origin, they are born from ignorance, they arise from ignorance."

‘‘Iti kho, bhikkhave, avijjāpaccayā saṅkhārā; saṅkhārapaccayā viññāṇaṃ…pe… evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa samudayo hoti. Avijjāya tveva asesavirāganirodhā saṅkhāranirodho; saṅkhāranirodhā viññāṇanirodho …pe… evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa nirodho hotī’’ti. Paṭhamaṃ.

"Thus, monks, with ignorance as condition, volitional formations; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness... Thus is the arising of this whole mass of suffering. But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations; with the cessation of volitional formations, cessation of consciousness... Thus is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering."
