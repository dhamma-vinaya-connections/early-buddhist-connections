## SN 12.66 The Right Comprehension Discourse

66. Evaṃ me sutaṃ – ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā kurūsu viharati kammāsadhammaṃ nāma kurūnaṃ nigamo. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi – ‘‘bhikkhavo’’ti. ‘‘Bhadante’’ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca – ‘‘sammasatha no tumhe, bhikkhave, antaraṃ sammasa’’nti [antarā sammasananti (sī.)]. Evaṃ vutte, aññataro bhikkhu bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘ahaṃ kho, bhante, sammasāmi antaraṃ sammasa’’nti. ‘‘Yathā kathaṃ pana tvaṃ, bhikkhu, sammasasi antaraṃ sammasa’’nti? Atha kho so bhikkhu byākāsi. Yathā so bhikkhu byākāsi na so bhikkhu bhagavato cittaṃ ārādhesi.

66.Thus have I heard—at one time the Blessed One was dwelling among the Kurus, at Kammāsadhamma, a town of the Kurus. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!” “Venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this: “Bhikkhus, do you comprehend the internal comprehension?” When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, I comprehend the internal comprehension.” “But how, bhikkhu, do you comprehend the internal comprehension?” Then that bhikkhu explained. However that bhikkhu explained, he did not please the Blessed One’s mind.

Evaṃ vutte, āyasmā ānando bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘etassa, bhagavā, kālo; etassa, sugata, kālo; yaṃ bhagavā antaraṃ sammasaṃ bhāseyya. Bhagavato sutvā bhikkhū dhāressantī’’ti. ‘‘Tenahānanda, suṇātha, sādhukaṃ manasi karotha; bhāsissāmī’’ti. ‘‘Evaṃ, bhante’’ti kho te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṃ. Bhagavā etadavoca –

When this was said, Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Blessed One, now is the time; Sugata, now is the time for the Blessed One to speak about the internal comprehension. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it.” “Then, Ānanda, listen and attend closely. I shall speak.” “Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:

‘‘Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sammasamāno sammasati antaraṃ sammasaṃ [sammasanaṃ (sī.)] – ‘yaṃ kho idaṃ anekavidhaṃ nānappakārakaṃ dukkhaṃ loke uppajjati jarāmaraṇaṃ. Idaṃ kho dukkhaṃ kiṃnidānaṃ kiṃsamudayaṃ kiṃjātikaṃ kiṃpabhavaṃ, kismiṃ sati jarāmaraṇaṃ hoti, kismiṃ asati jarāmaraṇaṃ na hotī’ti? So sammasamāno evaṃ jānāti – ‘yaṃ kho idaṃ anekavidhaṃ nānappakārakaṃ dukkhaṃ loke uppajjati jarāmaraṇaṃ. Idaṃ kho dukkhaṃ upadhinidānaṃ upadhisamudayaṃ upadhijātikaṃ upadhipabhavaṃ, upadhismiṃ sati jarāmaraṇaṃ hoti, upadhismiṃ asati jarāmaraṇaṃ na hotī’ti. So jarāmaraṇañca pajānāti jarāmaraṇasamudayañca pajānāti jarāmaraṇanirodhañca pajānāti yā ca jarāmaraṇanirodhasāruppagāminī paṭipadā tañca pajānāti. Tathāpaṭipanno ca hoti anudhammacārī. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sabbaso sammā dukkhakkhayāya paṭipanno jarāmaraṇanirodhāya.

“Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, comprehending, comprehends the internal comprehension thus: ‘This manifold, diverse suffering that arises in the world—aging and death. What is the cause of this suffering? What is its origin? What is its source? What is its condition? When what exists does aging and death occur? When what does not exist does aging and death not occur?’ Comprehending thus, he understands: ‘This manifold, diverse suffering that arises in the world—aging and death. This suffering has clinging as its cause, clinging as its origin, clinging as its source, clinging as its condition. When clinging exists, aging and death occur. When clinging does not exist, aging and death do not occur.’ He understands aging and death, the origin of aging and death, the cessation of aging and death, and the practice leading to the cessation of aging and death. He practices accordingly, living in accordance with the Dhamma. This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who is practicing perfectly for the complete destruction of suffering, for the cessation of aging and death.”

‘‘Athāparaṃ sammasamāno sammasati antaraṃ sammasaṃ – ‘upadhi panāyaṃ kiṃnidāno kiṃsamudayo kiṃjātiko kiṃpabhavo, kismiṃ sati upadhi hoti, kismiṃ asati upadhi na hotī’ti? So sammasamāno evaṃ jānāti – ‘upadhi taṇhānidāno taṇhāsamudayo taṇhājātiko taṇhāpabhavo, taṇhāya sati upadhi hoti, taṇhāya asati upadhi na hotī’ti. So upadhiñca pajānāti upadhisamudayañca pajānāti upadhinirodhañca pajānāti yā ca upadhinirodhasāruppagāminī paṭipadā tañca pajānāti. Tathā paṭipanno ca hoti anudhammacārī. Ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sabbaso sammā dukkhakkhayāya paṭipanno upadhinirodhāya.

“Then further, comprehending, he comprehends the internal comprehension thus: ‘But what is the cause of this clinging? What is its origin? What is its source? What is its condition? When what exists, does clinging exist? When what does not exist, does clinging not exist?’ Comprehending thus, he understands: ‘Clinging has craving as its cause, craving as its origin, craving as its source, craving as its condition. When craving exists, clinging exists. When craving does not exist, clinging does not exist.’ He understands clinging, the origin of clinging, the cessation of clinging, and the practice leading to the cessation of clinging. And he practices accordingly, living in accordance with the Dhamma. This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who is practicing perfectly for the complete destruction of suffering, for the cessation of clinging.”

‘‘Athāparaṃ sammasamāno sammasati antaraṃ sammasaṃ – ‘taṇhā panāyaṃ kattha uppajjamānā uppajjati, kattha nivisamānā nivisatī’ti? So sammasamāno evaṃ jānāti – yaṃ kho loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ etthesā taṇhā uppajjamānā uppajjati, ettha nivisamānā nivisati. Kiñca loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ? Cakkhuṃ loke piyarūpaṃ, sātarūpaṃ. Etthesā taṇhā uppajjamānā uppajjati, ettha nivisamānā nivisati. Sotaṃ loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ…pe… ghānaṃ loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ… jivhā loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ… kāyo loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ… mano loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ etthesā taṇhā uppajjamānā uppajjati ettha nivisamānā nivisati.

“Then further, comprehending, he comprehends the internal comprehension thus: ‘Where, when arising, does this craving arise? Where, when settling, does it settle?’ Comprehending thus, he understands: ‘Whatever in the world is beloved and agreeable, there, when arising, this craving arises; there, when settling, it settles. And what in the world is beloved and agreeable? The eye in the world is beloved and agreeable. There, when arising, this craving arises; there, when settling, it settles. The ear in the world is beloved and agreeable… The nose in the world is beloved and agreeable… The tongue in the world is beloved and agreeable… The body in the world is beloved and agreeable… The mind in the world is beloved and agreeable. There, when arising, this craving arises; there, when settling, it settles.”

‘‘Ye hi keci, bhikkhave, atītamaddhānaṃ samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā yaṃ loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ taṃ niccato addakkhuṃ sukhato addakkhuṃ attato addakkhuṃ ārogyato addakkhuṃ khemato addakkhuṃ.

Ye dukkhaṃ vaḍḍhesuṃ te na parimucciṃsu jātiyā jarāya maraṇena sokehi paridevehi dukkhehi domanassehi upāyāsehi, na parimucciṃsu dukkhasmāti vadāmi.

“Bhikkhus, whatever ascetics or brahmins in the past regarded what is beloved and agreeable in the world as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure—they increased craving. Those who increased craving increased clinging. Those who increased clinging increased suffering. Those who increased suffering were not freed from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair; they were not freed from suffering, I say.”

‘‘Yepi hi keci, bhikkhave, anāgatamaddhānaṃ samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā yaṃ loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ taṃ niccato dakkhissanti [dakkhinti (sī.)] sukhato dakkhissanti attato dakkhissanti ārogyato dakkhissanti khemato dakkhissanti.

Ye dukkhaṃ vaḍḍhissanti te na parimuccissanti jātiyā jarāya maraṇena sokehi paridevehi dukkhehi domanassehi upāyāsehi, na parimuccissanti dukkhasmāti vadāmi.

“Bhikkhus, any ascetics or brahmins whatsoever in the future who will regard what is beloved and agreeable in the world as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure—they will increase craving. Those who increase craving will increase clinging. Those who increase clinging will increase suffering. Those who increase suffering will not be freed from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair; they will not be freed from suffering, I say.”

‘‘Yepi hi keci, bhikkhave, etarahi samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā yaṃ loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ taṃ niccato passanti sukhato passanti attato passanti ārogyato passanti khemato passanti. Te taṇhaṃ vaḍḍhenti.

“Bhikkhus, any ascetics or brahmins whatsoever at present who regard what is beloved and agreeable in the world as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure—they increase craving. Those who increase craving increase clinging. Those who increase clinging increase suffering. Those who increase suffering are not freed from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair; they are not freed from suffering, I say.”

Pivato hi kho taṃ chādessati vaṇṇenapi gandhenapi rasenapi, pivitvā ca pana tatonidānaṃ maraṇaṃ vā nigacchasi maraṇamattaṃ vā dukkha’nti.

“Just as, bhikkhus, a drinking vessel might be beautiful in appearance, fragrant in smell, and delicious in taste, yet it is mixed with poison. Then a man might come along, overcome by heat, afflicted by heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. They would say to him: ‘Good man, this drinking vessel is beautiful in appearance, fragrant in smell, and delicious in taste; but it is mixed with poison. If you wish, drink. Drinking it will please you with its appearance, smell, and taste, but after drinking it, you will meet death or deadly suffering as a result.’ He would drink that poisoned drink hastily, without reflection, and would not reject it. As a result, he would meet death or deadly suffering. In the same way, bhikkhus, whatever ascetics or brahmins in the past regarded what is beloved and agreeable in the world as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure—they increased craving. Those who increased craving increased clinging. Those who increased clinging increased suffering. Those who increased suffering were not freed from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair; they were not freed from suffering, I say. And whatever ascetics or brahmins in the future will regard what is beloved and agreeable in the world as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure—they will increase craving. Those who increase craving will increase clinging. Those who increase clinging will increase suffering. Those who increase suffering will not be freed from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair; they will not be freed from suffering, I say. And whatever ascetics or brahmins at present regard what is beloved and agreeable in the world as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure—they increase craving. Those who increase craving increase clinging. Those who increase clinging increase suffering. Those who increase suffering are not freed from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair; they are not freed from suffering, I say.”

‘‘Ye ca kho keci, bhikkhave, atītamaddhānaṃ samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā yaṃ loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ taṃ aniccato addakkhuṃ dukkhato addakkhuṃ anattato addakkhuṃ rogato addakkhuṃ bhayato addakkhuṃ, te taṇhaṃ pajahiṃsu.

Ye dukkhaṃ pajahiṃsu te parimucciṃsu jātiyā jarāya maraṇena sokehi paridevehi dukkhehi domanassehi upāyāsehi, parimucciṃsu dukkhasmāti vadāmi.

“Bhikkhus, any ascetics or brahmins whatsoever in the past who saw what is beloved and agreeable in the world as impermanent, as suffering, as not-self, as a disease, as a danger—they abandoned craving. Those who abandoned craving abandoned clinging. Those who abandoned clinging abandoned suffering. Those who abandoned suffering were completely freed from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair; they were completely freed from suffering, I say.”

‘‘Yepi hi keci, bhikkhave, anāgatamaddhānaṃ samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā yaṃ loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ taṃ aniccato dakkhissanti dukkhato dakkhissanti anattato dakkhissanti rogato dakkhissanti bhayato dakkhissanti, te taṇhaṃ pajahissanti. Ye taṇhaṃ pajahissanti…pe… parimuccissanti dukkhasmāti vadāmi.

“Bhikkhus, any ascetics or brahmins whatsoever in the future who will see what is beloved and agreeable in the world as impermanent, as suffering, as not-self, as a disease, as a danger—they will abandon craving. Those who abandon craving will abandon clinging. Those who abandon clinging will abandon suffering. Those who abandon suffering will be completely freed from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair; they will be completely freed from suffering, I say.”

‘‘Yepi hi keci, bhikkhave, etarahi samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā yaṃ loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ taṃ aniccato passanti dukkhato passanti anattato passanti rogato passanti bhayato passanti, te taṇhaṃ pajahanti.

Ye dukkhaṃ pajahanti te parimuccanti jātiyā jarāya maraṇena sokehi paridevehi dukkhehi domanassehi upāyāsehi, parimuccanti dukkhasmāti vadāmi.

“Indeed, bhikkhus, whatever ascetics or brahmins there are now who see whatever is agreeable and delightful in the world as impermanent, as suffering, as not-self, as a disease, as a danger, they abandon craving. Those who abandon craving abandon attachments. Those who abandon attachments abandon suffering. Those who abandon suffering are fully liberated from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair; they are fully liberated from suffering, I say.”

‘‘Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, āpānīyakaṃso vaṇṇasampanno gandhasampanno rasasampanno. So ca kho visena saṃsaṭṭho. Atha puriso āgaccheyya ghammābhitatto ghammapareto kilanto tasito pipāsito.

“Just as, bhikkhus, suppose there was a bronze bowl of drinking water, endowed with color, scent, and taste. But it was mixed with poison. Then a man would come along, afflicted by heat, overcome by heat, tired, thirsty, and parched. They would say to him: ‘Here, good man, is this bronze bowl of drinking water, endowed with color, scent, and taste. But it is mixed with poison. If you wish, drink it. Drinking it will please you with its color, scent, and taste; but having drunk it, you will meet death or deadly suffering because of it.’ Then, bhikkhus, that man would think: ‘I could get rid of this thirst with water, or with whey, or with salted barley-meal drink, or with sour gruel. But I should not drink that, for it would not be for my long-term welfare and happiness.’ Having considered, he would not drink that bowl of water and would reject it. As a result, he would not meet death or deadly suffering. Just so, bhikkhus, whatever ascetics or brahmins in the past saw whatever was agreeable and delightful in the world as impermanent, as suffering, as not-self, as a disease, as a danger, they abandoned craving. Those who abandoned craving abandoned attachments. Those who abandoned attachments abandoned suffering. Those who abandoned suffering were fully liberated from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair; they were fully liberated from suffering, I say.”

‘‘Yepi hi keci, bhikkhave, anāgatamaddhānaṃ…pe… etarahi samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā yaṃ loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ taṃ aniccato passanti dukkhato passanti anattato passanti rogato passanti bhayato passanti, te taṇhaṃ pajahanti.

“Indeed, bhikkhus, whatever ascetics or brahmins there will be in the future… and whatever ascetics or brahmins there are now who see whatever is agreeable and delightful in the world as impermanent, as suffering, as not-self, as a disease, as a danger, they abandon craving. Those who abandon craving abandon attachments. Those who abandon attachments abandon suffering. Those who abandon suffering are fully liberated from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair; they are fully liberated from suffering, I say.” Sixth.
