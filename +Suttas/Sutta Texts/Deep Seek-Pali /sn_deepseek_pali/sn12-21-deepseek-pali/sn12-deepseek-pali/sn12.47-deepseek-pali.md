# SN 12.47 Jāṇussoṇisuttaṃ

## SN 12.47 The Discourse to Jāṇussoṇi

47. Sāvatthiyaṃ viharati. Atha kho jāṇussoṇi brāhmaṇo yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavatā saddhiṃ…pe… ekamantaṃ nisinno kho jāṇussoṇi brāhmaṇo bhagavantaṃ etadavoca –

47.The Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī. Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he exchanged cordial greetings and polite conversation with the Blessed One, and then sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi said to the Blessed One:

‘‘Kiṃ nu kho, bho, gotama, sabbamatthī’’ti? ‘‘‘Sabbamatthī’ti kho, brāhmaṇa, ayameko anto’’.

“Now, Master Gotama, does everything exist?” “‘Everything exists’—this, brahmin, is one extreme.”

‘‘Kiṃ pana, bho gotama, sabbaṃ natthī’’ti? ‘‘‘Sabbaṃ natthī’ti kho, brāhmaṇa, ayaṃ dutiyo anto. Ete te, brāhmaṇa, ubho ante anupagamma majjhena tathāgato dhammaṃ deseti – ‘avijjāpaccayā saṅkhārā; saṅkhārapaccayā viññāṇaṃ…pe… evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa samudayo hoti. Avijjāya tveva asesavirāganirodhā saṅkhāranirodho; saṅkhāranirodhā viññāṇanirodho…pe… evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa nirodho hotī’’’ti.

“Then, Master Gotama, does everything not exist?” “‘Everything does not exist’—this, brahmin, is the second extreme. Avoiding both these extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma by the middle: ‘With ignorance as condition, volitional formations arise; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness arises… Thus is the arising of this entire mass of suffering. But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations; with the cessation of volitional formations, cessation of consciousness… Thus is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering.’”

Evaṃ vutte, jāṇussoṇi brāhmaṇo bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘abhikkantaṃ bho gotama…pe… pāṇupetaṃ saraṇaṃ gata’’nti. Sattamaṃ.

When this was said, the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi said to the Blessed One: “Excellent, Master Gotama, excellent, Master Gotama! Just as if he were to set upright what had been overturned, or were to reveal what had been hidden, or were to show the way to one who was lost, or were to hold up a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyesight could see forms—in the same way has Master Gotama made the Dhamma clear in various ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha. From today onwards, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” The seventh.
