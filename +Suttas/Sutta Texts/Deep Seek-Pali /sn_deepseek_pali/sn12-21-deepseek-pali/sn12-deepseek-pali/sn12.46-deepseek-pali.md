# SN 12.46 Aññatarabrāhmaṇasuttaṃ

## SN 12.46 The Discourse with a Certain Brahmin

46. Sāvatthiyaṃ viharati. Atha kho aññataro brāhmaṇo yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavatā saddhiṃ sammodi. Sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho so brāhmaṇo bhagavantaṃ etadavoca –

46.The Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī. Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he exchanged cordial greetings and polite conversation with the Blessed One, and then sat down to one side. Seated to one side, that brahmin said to the Blessed One:

‘‘Kiṃ nu kho, bho gotama, so karoti so paṭisaṃvedayatī’’ti? ‘‘‘So karoti so paṭisaṃvedayatī’ti kho, brāhmaṇa, ayameko anto’’.

“Now, Master Gotama, is it that one does it and one experiences the result?” “‘One does it and one experiences the result’—this, brahmin, is one extreme.”

‘‘Kiṃ pana, bho gotama, añño karoti, añño paṭisaṃvedayatī’’ti? ‘‘‘Añño karoti, añño paṭisaṃvedayatī’ti kho, brāhmaṇa, ayaṃ dutiyo anto. Ete te, brāhmaṇa, ubho ante anupagamma majjhena tathāgato dhammaṃ deseti – ‘avijjāpaccayā saṅkhārā; saṅkhārapaccayā viññāṇaṃ…pe… evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa samudayo hoti. Avijjāya tveva asesavirāganirodhā saṅkhāranirodho; saṅkhāranirodhā viññāṇanirodho …pe… evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa nirodho hotī’’’ti.

“Then, Master Gotama, is it that one does [an action] and another experiences [the result]?” “‘One does [an action] and another experiences [the result]’—this, brahmin, is the second extreme. Avoiding both these extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma by the middle: ‘With ignorance as condition, volitional formations arise; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness arises… Thus is the arising of this entire mass of suffering. But with the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations; with the cessation of volitional formations, cessation of consciousness… Thus is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering.’”

Evaṃ vutte, so brāhmaṇo bhagavantaṃ etadavoca – ‘‘abhikkantaṃ, bho gotama, abhikkantaṃ, bho gotama,…pe… upāsakaṃ maṃ bhavaṃ gotamo dhāretu ajjatagge pāṇupetaṃ saraṇaṃ gata’’nti. Chaṭṭhaṃ.

When this was said, that brahmin said to the Blessed One: “Excellent, Master Gotama, excellent, Master Gotama! Just as if he were to set upright what had been overturned, or were to reveal what had been hidden, or were to show the way to one who was lost, or were to hold up a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyesight could see forms—in the same way has Master Gotama made the Dhamma clear in various ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha. From today onwards, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” The sixth.
