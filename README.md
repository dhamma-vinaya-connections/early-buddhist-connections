# Early Buddhist Connections (EBC)

> **A comprehensive, interconnected digital library of Early Buddhist Texts.**
> Designed for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to link the P캐li Canon with its parallels, indexes, and community research in a clean, offline-ready format.

---

## 游닀 About This Project
**Dhamma Vinaya Connections** is a digital library project designed for Bhikkhus, nuns, and serious Dhamma practitioners who need a robust, **offline** study environment.

It leverages the power of local linking to interconnect:
* **P캐li Root Texts** (Roman script)
* **English Translations** (Ven. Thanissaro, Ven. Sujato, Ven. Brahmali, and more)
* **Chinese gamas** (English parallels)
* **Vinaya Texts** (P캐timokkha & Khandhakas)
* **Vinaya Explanations** (BMC, Vibha攷ga analyses)

All files are stored locally on your device, ensuring privacy and accessibility even in remote locations without internet.

> [!WARNING] Performance Note for Mobile Users
> **The complete library contains over 20,000 files.**
> While modern computers handle this easily, many Android devices perform best with fewer than 10,000 files.
>
> If you are using this on a mobile device, we strongly recommend **deleting files you do not need** before open it in Obsidian (such as specific Pali-only versions or extra translations) to ensure the app runs smoothly.

## 游 Getting Started

### 1. Install Obsidian
This library runs on **Obsidian**, a free tool for personal knowledge management.
* [Download Obsidian here](https://obsidian.md/) (Available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS).

### 2. Download the Library
You have two options to get the texts:

#### Option A: The Easy Method (Recommended)
1.  Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/dhamma-vinaya-connections/early-buddhist-connections/releases) to get the latest version.
2.  *Alternatively:* Click the green **Code** button at the top right of this page and select **Download ZIP**.
3.  Unzip the folder to a location on your computer.

#### Option B: For Git Users
If you are familiar with Git, you can clone the repository to stay updated easily:

### 4 EBC Welcome
For help using the library open **EBC Welcome** notae for further help on how to use it inside obsidian

### 游늭 What's Inside?
#### 1. Suttas
Dynamic Indexes: Browse by Nikaya (DN, MN, SN, AN, KN) or by Topic (using subject indexes similar to Access to Insight and other websites).

Multiple Translations: Compare versions side-by-side (e.g., Ven. Thanissaro vs. Ven. Sujato).

Parallels: Direct links to Chinese gama parallels (English translations by Charles Patton).

#### 2. Vinaya
P캐timokkha: Bhikkhu and Bhikkhun캶 rules with word-for-word definitions, non-offense clauses, and origin stories.

Khandhakas: Complete Mahavagga and Cullavagga chapters.

Explanations: Deep links to The Buddhist Monastic Code (BMC) and Ven. 칌캐攷ㅡtusita's analysis, connecting directly to the relevant rules.

#### 3. The Catalogue
A powerful database view that allows you to:

Filter texts by translator, language, or root source.

Search for specific IDs (e.g., "MN 10").

Sort the entire collection dynamically.

丘멆잺 Important Usage Note
Do not rename or move any file or folder inside the **ebt-connections** folder. The links between texts are specific. Moving files out of their designated folders will break the automatic connections between P캐li roots and English translations.
